Main thing we do in linear algebra is solve m x n systems of linear equations
- Many solutions
- Unique solution
- None

When adding vectors, add the components that "line up"

## Linear Combinations of Vectors
$V$ = `(13 17 21)` 
$X_1$ = `(1 2 3)`
$X_2$ = `(4 5 9)`
$X_3$ = `(7 8 9)`
"V is a linear combination of $X_1$, $X_2$ , $X_3$  defined by $V = 3X_1 - X_2 + 2X_3$

Solve a system of $j$ write answer in Vector form
$x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 4$
$3x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3$ = 10
Proper form :
$X = (2\ 2\ 0) + t(-2\ 1\ 1)$  <-(but vertically)


### Rank ($r$)
```Augmented_matrix
1  0 -1  1 | -2
0  1  0  0 |  1
0  0  0  0 |  0
```
The rank of this matrix is the number of the leading ones (once in RREF). ($r=2$)
###### Basic Columns
The **basic columns** of the *original matrix* are those that correspond to the columns containing the leading 1's in the **RREF**.
*It follows that the number of basic columns will equal the rank*

We relate the rank of a matrix to the qualitative theory of solutions to a system of equations

"For a homogenous system, the last column of the augmented matrix is all zeros, so we may ignore it. 
The rank of coefficient matrix = rank of augmented matrix"

### Theorem
Let A be the m x n coefficient matrix to a homogeneous system of equations and A has rank r. Then **the ==system has $n-r$ free variables**== (parameters)


### Basic Solutions
Once we get a homogenous linear system of equations in RREF, we can express the "solution" as a linear combination of Vectors.
```RREF
1  0  0  |  0
0  1 -1  |  0
```
letting $z=t$
we now have:
$x = 0 + 0t$
$y=0+t$
$z=t$
so:
$X_1$ = `[0 0 0] + t[0 1 1]` <- in which $X_1$ are the solutions
and `[0 1 1]` is the **basic solution**.

The basic solutions of a homogenous system of equations are columns constructed from the coefficients on parameters in the solution.

Another example:
If we have the equation $x + 4y + 3z = 0$
$x = -4s -3t$
$y=s$
$z=t$
this can be written as:
`[x y z] = [0 0 0] + s[-4 1 0] + t[-3 0 1]`
And therefore there are TWO basic solutions: `[-4 1 0]` and`[-3 0 1]`
So, a linear combination of basic solutions to a homogenous system is a solution to the system and EVERY solution can be written as a linear combination of these basic solutions. 

Also note that the number of "basic solutions" are equal to the number of free variables / parameters

1. The system is consistent exactly when rank of the augmented matrix = r = rank of coefficient matrix
2. If the system is consistent and $r = n$ then the solution is unique (no free variables)
3. If $r < n$ the system has many solutions.
