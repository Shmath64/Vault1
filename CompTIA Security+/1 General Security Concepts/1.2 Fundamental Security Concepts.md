Combination of principles: fundamentals of security
AKA "AIC" Triad (to prevent confusion with Central Intelligence Agency)

## CIA Triad
### Confidentiality
- Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals or systems
- Certain information should only be known to certain people (prevent unauthorized information disclosure)
- Encryption!
- Access Controls
	- Selectively restrict access to a resource
	- TFA/MFA
### Integrity
- Messages can't be modified without detection
- Data is stored and transferred as intended
	- Any modification to the data would be identified
- ==Hashing== - Sending a hash alongside data
- ==Digital Signatures== 
	- Mathematical Scheme to verify the integrity of data
- ==Digital Certificates== - Combine with a digital signature to verify identity
### Availability
- Systems and networks must be up and running at all times
- Information accessible always to authorized users
- ==Redundancy==
- ==Fault tolerance==
- Patching: Ensure stability and close all security holes!

## Non-repudiation
Can't deny what you've said; think of signing a contract.
- **Proof of integrity**: data remains accurate and consistent. In cryptography, we can use a #hash - This doesn't necessarily associate data with an individual.
- **Proof of origin**: authentication; digital signature; prove it was sent by the right person. In cryptography, we use a digital signature (a #private_key) that's verified with a #public_key.
- "**Digital Signatures**" are created by encrypting the hash of the "plain text" with the #private_key: This is the *digital signature*
	- The public key is then used to decrypt the digital signature (which reveals the hash of the file). The receiver of the file then runs the file through the same hashing algorithm, and checks to make sure the hash matches.

## Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)
- #Identification (Who you claim to be): username
- #Authentication (Prove you're who you say you are): password and others.
- #Authorization Based on *identification* and *authentication*, what access do you have?
- #Accounting the '==logs=='; login time, data sent and received, logout time.

### Authenticating Systems
Put a digitally signed certificate on the device! This verifies it as e.g. a company owned laptop!
Other business processes rely on the certificate. 
#Certificate_Authentication: An organization has a trusted #Certificate_Authority (**CA**) of which the digital signature is used to verify a certificate.

### Authorization Models
No authorization model is just assigning Users and services -> Data and applications 
- Problem: doesn't scale well
So, define an #Authorization_Model by ==roles, organizations, attributes, etc.==
- Reduces complexity and administrations is streamlined (scaled better and easier to understand)


## Gap Analysis
Study of the difference between you are and where you want to be; the 'gap'.
This often requires extensive research. Can take weeks or months

- Work towards a known baseline: a specific #framework! (e.g. ISO/IEC 27001) These will often involve: 
	- Evaluate people and processes; training, experience, knowledge of security policies and procedures
	- Examine the current processes.

### 'Analysis Portion'
Involves evaluating existing systems, identifying weaknesses and creating a "detailed analysis" (which involves starting with a broad understanding of security concepts to small specific things)

After deciding the objectives, and doing the analysis, time comes for the final report. And then figuring out the path to get from current security to the goal.


## Zero Trust
Many networks are relatively open on the inside (once your past the firewall)
Zero trust is a holistic approach to network security: covers every device, every process, every user.
==Everything must be verified==! Nothing is inherently trusted, multi-factor authentication, encryption, system permissions, additional firewall, monitoring and analytics, etc.

### Planes of operation
Think about splitting a network into functional planes.
Applies to physical, virtual, and cloud components.
- **Data plane**:
	- Process the frames, packets and network data; performing the *actual security process*
	- Processing, forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT
- **Control plane**:
	- Manages the actions of the data plane
	- Defines polices and rules
	- Determines how packets should be forwarded
	- Routing tables, session tables, NAT tables.
	- **Adaptive Identity**: consider the source and requested resources. Considers multiple risk indicators:
		- IP address, type of connection, relationship to the organization
	- **Threat Scope reduction**: reduce the number of possible entry points
	- **Policy Driven access control**: Combine the adaptive identity with a predefined set of rules
**Security Zones**: Security is more than a one-to-one relationship; may want to deny access from *untrusted* zone traffic to *trusted* zone traffic.

**Policy Enforcement Point** (PEP) is the "gatekeeper" (may be multiple devices working together).
- Allows, monitors and terminates connections from: end users, applications, non-human entities,
- It gathers all information about the traffic, but the ==**Policy Decision Point**== is what decides to trust the authentication. 
**The Policy Decision Point includes:**
- **Policy engine**: evaluates each access decision based on policy and other information sources.
- **Policy Administrator**: communicates with the Policy Enforcement Point, generates access tokens or credentials, and tells the PEP to allow or disallow access.

## Physical Security
Barricades / Bollards are to prevent physical access from cars.

Access control *vestibule*: a room you must get through to enter the building. Opening one door causes the others to lock, or all doors are normally locked (unlocking one door prevents others from being unlocked). The purpose is to control access through an area.

**CCTV**: Closed Circuit Television (Security cameras)

Infrared technologies are useful for motion detectors covering a small area, while **Microwave** sensors are better for detecting movement across large areas. Even more advanced is **Ultrasonic** technology that can also provide collision detection.
