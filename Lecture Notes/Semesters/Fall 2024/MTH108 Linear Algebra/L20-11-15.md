## Linear Transformations

$T: \mathbb{R}^n \implies \mathbb{R}^m$
$T: Y \implies T(X)$
"The *image* of X *under* T"
The **image/range** of T is:
$\{Y\in \mathbb{R}^n: Y = T(X)\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$

Linear transformations "respecting linear combinations" ([[L19-11-13]]) also means it must "preserve" the origin
 
"Practically, a linear transformation IS a matrix"
Applying the transformation is really just multiplying by a matrix!

e.g.
T(<$x_1, x_2$>) = 
│$x_1 + x_2$ │
│$x_1 - x_2$ │
│    $2x_1$   │

Let $e_i$ denote the standard basis vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then:
$A = (T(e_1) | T(e_2) | ... | T(e_n))$
