### Tail Recursion
A function is *tail recursive* when each recursive path (case) has exactly *one* recursive call that is the last executed statement in the current function call. (Not necessarily last line of code)

```Lisp
;Non-tail Recursive:
(defun my-sum1 (x) 
	(if (null x) 0
		(+ ;Last evaluated form is sum
			(first x)
			(my-sum1 (rest x)))))

;Tail-recursive
(defun my-sum1 (x &optional (acc 0)) ;Default acc to 0
	(if (null x) acc
		(my-sum1 (rest x) (+ (first x) acc)))) ;my-sum1 is the last form evaluated

```

Compilers and interpreters manage access to a function's local variables and returning value using a **stack frame**
- When a function is called, a stack frame handles the local variables.
- Tail recursion allows for optimal use of the runtime stack by requiring only one stack frame

**Exercise**: write a tail recursive function that reverses the list
```Lisp
(defun reverseList (x &optional (acc ()))
  (if (null x)
      acc
      (reverseList (cdr x) (cons (first x) acc))))
```

If the last line makes two function calls, its NOT tail-recursive

Homework:
Write a recursive version of Item-Count:
```Lisp
(defun item-count (seq)
	(let ((result ()))
		(dolist (item seq result)
			(let ((temp (find item result :key 'first)))
				(if temp (incf (second temp))
					(push (list item 1) result))))))
```
