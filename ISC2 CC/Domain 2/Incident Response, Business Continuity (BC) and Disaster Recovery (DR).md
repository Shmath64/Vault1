This is all focused on the "*availability*" of the *CIA triad*

- **Incident Response plan** responds to *unexpected changes* in *operating conditions* to keep business operating
- **Business Continuity plan** enables the business to continue operating **throughout** the crisis
- If both fail, the **Disaster Recovery plan** is activated to help the business return to normal operations as quickly as possible

Key topics of this domain:
- Recovery Strategies
- Continuity Strategies
- Incident Management

##### Incident Terminology
- **Breach**: loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure/acquisition or similar occurrence where: an unauthorized person potentially accesses PII OR an authorized person accesses PII for an unauthorized purpose
- **Event**: any observable occurrence in a network or system
- **Exploit**: A particular attack that "exploits" system vulnerabilities
- **Incident**: An event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system.
- **Intrusion**: A security event or combination of events that constitutes a deliberate security incident in which an "intruder" gains/attempts to gain access to a system or system resource without authorization.
- **Threat**: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (e.g. mission, functions, reputation, etc), assets, individual, other organizations or the nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information and/or DOS.
- **Vulnerability**: Weakness in an information system, security procedure, internal controls, or implementation.
- **Zero Day**: Previously unknown system vulnerability. It does not fit recognized patterns, signatures or methods


Incident Response Planning is a subset of the greater discipline of business continuity management (BCM)

There is sometimes a "red book" that serves as a hard-copy backup accessible outside the facility containing outlined procedures in case electronic access is unavailable.

#### Disaster Recovery
Steps in where Business Continuity leaves off.
the Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) guides the actions of emergency response personnel until the end goal is reached-which is to see the business restored to full last-known reliable options

**DRP** (Disaster Recovery Plan) is about restoring IT while the **BCP** (Business Continuity Plan) focuses on business operations

##### Components of a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)
Depending on size the size of the organization, it may maintain multiple types of plan documents (that are intended for different audiences)
- **Executive summary** providing a high-level overview of the plan; this will help them communicate the issue accurately without taking time away from IT personnel.
- **Department-Specific plans**
- **Technical Guides** for IT personnel
- Full copies of the plan for critical disaster recovery team members

##### Components of a Business Continuity Plan
Business continuity planning (BCP) is the proactive development of procedures to restore business operations after a disaster.
This is more so a business function than a technical one, however, IT must align with the business needs.
- List of BCP team members and contact information
- Immediate response procedures/checklists
- Notification systems and call trees for alerting personnel that BCP is being enacted
- Guidance for management including designation of authority for specific managers
- Conditions for when to enact BCP

**Business Impact Analysis** **(BIA)** evaluates information system's requirements, functions and interdependencies. It's used to characterize system contingency requirements and priorities in the event of a significant disruption.

##### Components of the Incident Response Plan
1. Preparation
	- Policy approved by management
	- Identify critical data and systems and single points of failure
	- Staff training
	- Identify roles and responsibilities
2. Detection & Analysis
	- Monitor all possible attack vectors
	- Analyse the incident using known data and threat intelligence
	- Standardize incident documentation
3. Containment, Eradication & Recovery
	 - Gather evidence
	 - Choose an appropriate containment strategy
	 - Identify the attacker and isolate the attack
4. Post-Incident Activity
	 - Identify evidence that may need to be retained
	 - Document lessons learned
	 - Conduct a retrospective of all these components

"The intent of a business continuity plan is to sustain business operations while recovering from a significant disruption"

CIRT: Computer Incident Response Team
- Determine the amount/scope of damage
- Determine whether confidential information was compromised
- Implement any necessary recovery procedures to restore security and recover from incident-related damage
- Supervise the implementation of any additional security measures necessary to improve security and prevent recurrence of the incident.
