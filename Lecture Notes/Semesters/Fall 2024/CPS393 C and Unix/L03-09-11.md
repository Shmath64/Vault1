Continuing [[u1]]

On a directory, 
- read permissions means you can `ls` and see the contents of the file.
- 'x' permissions means you can still look at the contents of a file *if you know the name* (and you've got read permissions on the thing)

### Streams
For every command in Linux, there are three streams
0. `stdin` (standard input) 
1. `stdout` (standard output)
2. `stderr` (standard error)

The *shell* normally attaches other end of the streams to devices such as keyboard and monitor

if you write `cat` without anything, the terminal will wait for keyboard input. `CTRL+D` sends an 'end of input' symbol while `CTRL+C` kills the program.

##### Redirection
Use `>` to **redirect** any std stream
e.g.
`ls > lsout` Will run `ls` but the `stdout` stream will go into the file `lsout` (creating it if DNE)
`ls -l >> lsout` will run `ls-l` but will *append* the output to `lsout` (not replace)

`cat <lsout`  will place what's in `lsout` in stdin and cat will run from that

`cat <infile >outfile` will take input from `infile` (placing on `stdin`) and route `stdout` to `outfile`

`ls file1 file2 notARealFile > newFile` will place "file1" and "file2" in "newfile" but the error message caused by `notARealFile` will still appear on the terminal (because it's placed on `stderr`)

`stderr` can be redirected by using `2>`
```Linux
$ ls abbbb 2> lsout
$ cat lsout
ls: cannot access 'abbbb': No such file or directory
```


### "Garbage Pail"
`/dev/null` is the **black hole**
`/dev` is a directory on Linux where there are "devices"? (not super important rn)
