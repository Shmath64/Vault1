	- Backups, policies for reporting security issues, contacting law enforcement, using a fire extinguisher (stop it from spreading further)
- **Compensating**
	- Control using other means
	- May be temporary when controls aren't sufficient
	- Preventing the exploitation of a weakness
	- Simultaneous security guards (not one with access to everything)
	- Using a power generator!
- **Directive Control Type**
