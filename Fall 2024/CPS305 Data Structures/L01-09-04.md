Euclid (~300BC) recognized that objects have **structure** and attributes

Today, we use ***data structures*** to build models of objects, ***algorithms*** to reason about and simulate change in such models, we use ***programming languages*** to encode algorithms for execution by a computer.

**Data structures** are about looking at the pros and cons of each structure vis-Ã -vis the problem you are trying to solve.
**Algorithms**: is about analysing the trade-offs between space and time efficiency in the changes one or another algorithms causes in a model.

Pros of using *Lisp* for data structures:
- Provides enough control of concrete data (direct access on how data is accessed and manipulated by the program)
- Functional programming features can make it easy to manipulate and transform data structures
- Highly interactive development environment
- Lisp's list data structure is unique in that it allows for easy construction of recursive data structures
- Data structure programming skills you learn in this course will transfer to almost any language you use in the future.


# Lisp crash course

Central to the language is the concept of a "form" which can be evaluated
	**Lisp is case insensitive!**
You could say it uses "*prefix notation*" i.e. operator then operands

Various forms:
- Numbers: 2, 2.0, 3/5
- Individual characters: #\a, #\@
- Strings: "abcd"
- Boolean constants: `T` and `Nil` (note that everything that's not nil is true)
- Lisp symbol: evaluates to the value it identifies, made up of letters, numbers and characters e.g. + - / * = < > ? ! _
	- Examples: `foo`, `*4ice*`
- Function application: A non-empty list whose elements are themselves forms `( f a1 a2 ... an)` where `f` must evaluate to a function
- Special form

`sqrt` is a built-in function NOT a special form!

Exercise:
1. (a + b) * (c - d)
2. 2 * (x + y) / (3 - z)
3. sqrt((p^2 + q^2) / r)

```Lisp
(* 
	(+ a b)
	(- c d)
)
```

```Lisp

```

```Lisp
(sqrt
	(/
		(+ 
			(* p p)
			(* q q)
		)
		r
	) 
)
```

We can also categorize "lisp forms" as one of the three:
1. Atoms (single pieces of data) e.g. `3`
2. Function Applications e.g. `(+ 3 5)`
3. Special Forms e.g. `(defvar x 3)`
