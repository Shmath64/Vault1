**REPL: Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop**

Special form **eval** forces evaluation of the form provided as an argument
`(eval '(+ 2 x)`

### COND special form
```Lisp
(defun whereis (city)
  (cond ((eq city 'toronto) 'canada)
        ((eq city 'boston) 'usa)
        (t 'unknown)))
```
Each clause is tested 1 by 1.

## Looping DOTIMES
```Lisp
(DOTIMES (var count-form (result-form)) body-form)
```

1. Evaluate `count-form` to see if it it's greater than `0`
2. Set `var` to zero
3. Eval each `body-form` (as in `progn`)
4. increment `var` by 1

```Lisp
(let ((temp 1))
  (dotimes (temp1 3 temp)
    (setf temp (+ temp temp1))
    (format t "Temp: ~a Temp1: ~a" temp temp1)))
```

There is a built-in function `RETURN` that allows you to exit the loop (of course typically used with a conditional)! `RETURN` also causes the whole `DOTIMES` form to be evaluated to the argument.
