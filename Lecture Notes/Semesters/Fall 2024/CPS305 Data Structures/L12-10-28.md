Practicum test 2 will be just like Practicum 1 in style.

## Recursion Vs Iteration
Recursion is usually slower than iteration because of stack frame allocation.
Tail call optimization makes recursions faster but it is not always possible (and ISN'T implemented in all languages)

Main reasons to use recursion:
- Simplification of Complex Problems
- Recursive data Structures
- Cleaner; more readable code

Recursion is better to use when "depth" will be shallow


**Tail-Recursive Version of *Append*** (for lists)
1. Use stack (as optional parameter)
2. If first list is not empty, push on the stack the items of the first list
3. Pop the elements on the stack and push to the second list.
```Lisp
(defun my-append (a b &optional stack)
	(cond (a (my-append (cdr a) b (cons (car a) stack)))
		(stack (my-append a (cons (car stack) b) (cdr stack)))
		(t b))))
```

## Key-Value Pairs
The most "basic" data structure 
- technically using this in arrays (the most basic implementation)

Applications:
- Memoization
- Dictionaries
- Internal Tables

#### "Association Lists" (a-lists)
a list of "cons pairs", e.g. `((:foo . "bar") (42 . ("baz")))` in which `foo` is the key and `"bar"` is the value.

To look up an entry: use `assoc` 
e.g.
```Lisp
> (defparameter a-list '((x . "1") (y. "2")))
> (assoc 'x a-list)
> (car (assoc 'x a-list))
"1"
> (cdr (assoc 'x a-list))
"2"
```

To add an entry: `cons` or `push` 
To remove an entry: `remove`

### Hash Tables
("Concrete key-value structures")
Offer the same functionality as an association list
- Supply a key and the table, and you get back the item associated with that key
- *very fast* item look up and deletion
- Implemented using arrays rather than lists (as in "a-lists")
- **Unlike a-lists hash table elements are not visible to the user at the REPL** <- ?

**Lisp's interface**

- `make-hash-table` (`eq` is used to compare keys)
- `gethash` is used to look up an item
- `setf` and `gethash` are used to store an item
- `remhash` to remove a key
- `inspect` is used to inspect a table.

```Lisp
> (setf ht1 (make-hash-table))
> (gethash :foo ht1)
nil ;Returned by Default (nothing maped to 'foo)
nil ;Returns either t or nil depending on if something was found
> (setf (gethash :foo ht1) "bar")
"bar"
t
> (gethash :foo ht1)
"bar"
T
```

```Lisp
(defparameter *h* (make-hash-table))

(loop for (key value) in '((superman 1938)...)...)
	(setf ...)
```

`maphash` calls functions with two arguments, the key and value of that entry.
