## Trees!
Applications in:
- Programming Languages and compilers
- Operating systems (file directory structure)
- Gaming
- Data compression

"Keys" are just the values stored within each node of a tree

We can think of an HTML page as a tree in which tags are nodes.

Trees:
- Have a root node
- Have a *unique* path to traverse from root to each node
 
If each node has a maximum of two children, it's a **binary tree**

"A tree is either empty or consists of a root and zero or more subtrees, each of which is also a tree"

#### Implementation
```Lisp
(defstruct (tree-node (:conc-name nil))
	key ; Root node
	(lc nil) ; Left child (subtree)
	(rc nil)) ; right child (subtree)
```
The `(:conc-name nil)` means that accessors look like `key`, `lc` and `rc`, instead of `tree-node-key` etc.


```Lisp
> (make-tree-node :key 'a
	 :lc (make-tree-node :key 'b)
	 :rc (make-tree-node :key 'c
						 :lc (make-tree-node :key 'd)
						 :rc (make-tree-node :key 'e)))

#S(TREE-NODE
   :KEY A
   :LC #S(TREE-NODE :KEY B :LC NIL :RC NIL)
   :RC #S(TREE-NODE
          :KEY C
          :LC #S(TREE-NODE :KEY D :LC NIL :RC NIL)
          :RC #S(TREE-NODE :KEY E :LC NIL :RC NIL)))
```


When looking at a `defun` form, the "root node" is the symbol `defun`
In a list, the "root node" is the first cons cell? <= uncertain about this

## Beyond Binary
```Lisp
(defstruct (tree-node (:conc-name nil))
	key
	children) ; List of nodes
```
