### C++ Vectors
They're like Python lists (use dynamically allocated arrays), except:
- Python, lists are heterogenous (different object types), unlike C++ Vectors which are homogenous
- Data in vectors is stored in linear arrangement whereas a Python list is a collection of references to the type on the memory address of the variables.

C++
- Vectors use contiguous memory (likke arrays)
- Lists are non-contiguous
- Each element of a vector takes only storage for the element type itself
- Can randomly access vector elements (O(1)) but must traverse lists (O(n))

Vectors grow by powers of 2. 
	As elements are added one by one, the "capacity" of the vector goes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. Doubles its size when it needs more space!
The "size" of the vector is the number of elements in it.

Index elements in Vectors using: `myVector[i]`
"Range based for loop"
```Cpp
for (auto& x: myVector) //auto means figure out the type!
	cout << x << " ";
cout << endl;
```

#### Iterators!
Can define iterators like so:
```CPP
vector<int>::iterator startIter; //of type int-vector iterator
startIter = myVector.begin();
myVector.insert(startIter + 1, 99); //insert 99 at myVector[1], moving later integers over

```
`vector<int>::iterator startIter;` of type int-vector iterator
With iterators, we can:
- `myVector.erase(startIter + 2);` 
	- Erases `myVector[2]` and moves things "back"`

`int &w1 = myVector.at(1);` element 1 in myVector, modifiable
`const int &w2 = myVector.at(2);` immutable
With C++, we don't need to dereference things like we did in C.
`w1 = 77;` will then change element 1 to 77
##### References
`int &w1;` is a "reference" which is just like a pointer but can't be changed.
Also, references are automatically dereferenced while pointers require `*`

#### Reading from stdin
```C++
vector <string> sentence;
string word;
vector <string>::iterator startIter;

while(cin >> word) { //Extraction operator
	sentence.push_back(word);
}
```

#### Static Members
Shared across the *class*, i.e. *every* object
```C++
class Rectangle() {
	private:
		static int count; // Can't initialize here!
	public:
		static int box_count() {
			return count;
		}
}
int Rectangle::count=0; // static data member invoked via class name

```

This is the end of C++, up to `rectangleStatic.cpp`
