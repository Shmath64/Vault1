## In-Class Notes
#### Rhetorical Triangle
(Never goes away)
- Logos (facts)
- Ethos (who you are)
- Pathos (emotion)

#### Presentation Tips:
- Bring bulletpoints up one at a time (don't give everything at once)
- Never turn your back
- Don't focus on yourself, focus on the message and deliver it with passion
	- This is an act! Worst advice is to "just be yourself"
- Don't read from phone or slides!
- Slides should be your "guide", nothing more. Know the stuff front to back
- Okay to look at the back wall, not everyone in the eye





When saying negative things, spin them positively
