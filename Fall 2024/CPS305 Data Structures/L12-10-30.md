## Hash-Tables
(WHOOO)

The best execution times for searching so far:
- O(log n) - Binary Search
- O(n) - Linear Search

**Direct-Addressing** allows us to do it in O(1)
Issue is that if the values are large, we'll need to use large arrays to store the data using direct addressing.


Using a **hash function** we want to *compute* the array index where we will store a value.
Define a function *h* (hash function) that given an *k*, returns *h(k)* such that:
- $0\leq h(k) < n$
- $h(k)$ should be uniformly distributed in that interval
- minimizes the number of collisions $h(k_1) \neq h(k_2) \implies k_1 \neq k_2$
We say:
"k **hashes** to slot h(k)"
"$h(k)$ is the **hash value** of k"

If we wish to store a set of integers in an array that has 11 slots, we may use the function:
$h(k) = k \mod 11$

To resolve the issues of collisions, we can use:
- **Chaining**
- **Open Addressing With Linear Probing**
- **Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing**

#### Chaining
When two keys hash to the same integer (index of the array), store both items in a list.

Drawbacks:
- Mixing arrays and lists complicates the implementation
- Requires more memory than just the array
- Poor performance due to the linked structure.


### Open Addressing With Linear Probing
Pretty much, if there's a collision, just "step" forward in the array to *insert* or *find* or whatever you're doing. (Here we're just adding 1, but in theory we could add any constant)
$h'(k)=k \mod 10$
$h(k, i) = (h'(k) + 1) \mod 10$

Lets say we insert 3 elements that hash to 0,
then we have elements in 0, 1, 2
if we delete 1, we MUST mark this as deleted (not just the normal "nil")
This is because, if we then search for the element at 2 (that belongs are zero), then we won't be able to find it if we "step" from 0.

##### Clustering
A major disadvantage of this is the tendency for **clustering**
If we search for a key that's NOT in the table, and there's a big cluster there, we'll have to check a lot of spots (starting to look a bit like a linear search)


### Quadratic Probing
(lookout, lab07)
Don't just add a constant when we get a collision, add an increasing amount
$h'(k) = k \mod M$
$h(k, i) = (h'(k) + i + i^2) \mod M$

Example of probing sequence:
1. $h'(k)$, (i=0)
2. $h'(k) + 2$, (i=1)
3. $h'(k) + 6,$ ... (i=2)

This helps prevent clustering!
