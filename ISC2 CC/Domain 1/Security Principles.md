## Risk Management
Level of cybersecurity required depends on the level of risk the entity is willing to accept.
#### Protecting Information
Sometimes, a piece of data on its own isn't PII (e.g. date of birth) but with other pieces of data (e.g. picture of face and a name) it IS PII.

Level of controls depends on the sensitivity of private data and geographic location
- In the US HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) controls how the privacy medical information must be maintained.
- In the EU, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
These are each **regulations**
There are standards and frameworks that assist companies in complying to regulations, or just to increase cybersecurity 

#### Risk Management Terminology
- **Asset**: something in need of protection.
- **Vulnerability**: a gap or weakness in protection efforts.
- **Threat**: something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts.

\* Executive management and the board of directors are responsible for determining risk tolerance in an organization

- Always communicate identified risks clearly (and what the consequence of ignorance may be)
- Employees at all levels of the organization are responsible for identifying risk


3 common types of Authentication are:
- Something you know (passwords)
- Something you have (tokens, smart cards, etc.)
- Something you are (biometrics)


## Governance Elements
"Laws and regulations \[carry financial penalties for non-compliance] guide the development of standards \[provides a framework to introduce policies and procedures in support of regulations], which cultivate polices \[provide guidance in all activities to support standards and regulations] which result in procedures \[detailed steps to support policies]"
Laws & Regulations -> Standards -> policies -> procedures

#### Regulations and Laws
Can be imposed by governments at the national, regional or local level. Most notably HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
#### Standards
Organizations use multiple standards as part of their information systems security programs, both as compliance documents and as advisories/guidelines. Think of ISO 27001
#### Policies
Informed by applicable laws and specifies which standards and guidelines the organization will follow. 
Policies are carried out by *people*.

#### Procedures 
Define the specific, repeatable activities necessary to accomplish a specific task or set of tasks. Procedures often also establish measurement criteria/methods to determine whether a task has been successfully completed.


##### Non-Repudiation
The inability to deny taking an action such as creating information, approving information, or sending or receiving a message.
It IS a legal term.

##### Risk Treatment
- Avoidance
	- Attempt to eliminate the risk entirely. (think ceasing operation)
- Acceptance
	- Taking no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring.
- Mitigation
	- Taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk event or its impact. This involves security controls, policies, procedures and standards
- Transference
	- Passing the risk to another party who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment. Typically, an insurance policy.

## Security Controls
- Physical
- Administrative
	- Directives, guidelines, advisories aimed at the people within the organization. Provides frameworks, constraints, and standards for human behaviour.
- Technical (AKA Logical)
