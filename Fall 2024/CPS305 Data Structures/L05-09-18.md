#### Macros
Assignment statement 
- `(setf var form)` and `(:= var form)` <- this is a *macro*

"Macros are ways to define a new language"???
`CL-USER> (macroexpand '(:= x 0))` will expand what this macro means

Macros are lisp expressions which expand into "lower level" lisp expressions.

## Analysis of Running time
- When evaluating a form (that does not involve loops or recursion, we can assume constant time
	- Running Time: $T(n) = c$
	- Order of magnitude: $O(1)$
	- We will sometimes count this as just 1 (unit of time).

##### LET and LET*
`(LET varInits form*)` <- Remember that `form*` means "one or more forms"
Each assignment in a `let` statement counts as a single unit of time.
Also assume O(1) unless the forms involve loops/recursion

##### Loops
`(DOTIMES preamble bodyForm*)` or `(DO preamble bodyForm*)`
Execution time for a loop: $T(n) = T(n_{preamble}) + T(n_{bodyForm*})$
e.g.
```Lisp
(dotimes (i n) ; Repeats n times
	(:= x (+ i b)) 
	(:= y (* x 2)))
```
Running time is:
$\sum^{n-1}_{i=0} (1+1) = 2n$ ; therefore, order of magnitude is $O(n)$ <- This means "Linear"


When we have a nested loop, we'll end up with something more like:
$\sum^{n-1}_{i=0} (1+\sum^{n-1}_{j=0} 1) = \sum^{n-1}_{i=0} (1+n) = n + n^2$ ; so order of magnitude is $O(n^2)$
