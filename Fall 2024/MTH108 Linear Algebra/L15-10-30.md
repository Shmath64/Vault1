### Linear Combination and Span!

Showing that one vector is a linear combination of some other vectors amounts to showing that the $m\times n$ system: $AX=B$

To check if the vector $V=$<4 -4 7 -3> is a linear combination of:
$V_1=$<2 -1 3 0>
$V_2=$<-1 1 1 2>
$V_3=$<3 0 1 1>

We can make the augmented matrix:
```Matrix
2  -1  3 |  4
-1  1  0 | -4
3   1  1 |  7
0   2  1 | -3
```
And solve!

We can then say that $V$ is in the *span* of $V_1, V_2, V_3$

Geometrically, 
$span\{V_1, V_2\} = \mathbb{R}^2$
When $V_1$ and $V_2$ aren't collinear

Consider 3 Vectors, $V_1, V_2, V_3$,
if we have something like:
$3V_1 + V_2 - V_3 = 0$,
Then we can write one Vector as a linear combination of the others.
So if $V \in span\{V_1, V_2, V_3\}$, then we can write V as a linear combination of $V_1$ and $V_2$
	So, $span\{V_1, V_2, V_3\} = span\{V_1, V_2\} = span\{V_1, V_3\} =span\{V_2, V_3\}$

Shown:
Since we have, $V_3=3V_1+V_2$, then:
$V = x_1V_1 + x_2V_2 + x_3V_3$
$= x_1 V_1+ x_2V_2 + x_3(3V_1+V_2)$
$= V_1(x_1+3x_3) + V_2(x_2 + x_3)$

A set of vectors is called **linearly dependent** if there are non-zero scalars $x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n$ such that:
$x_1V_1 + x_2V_2 + ... + x_nV_n = 0$

i.e. If we can write a linear combination of the vectors that = 0 

If we can't, they are called **linearly independent**
Therefore, the only way we could write that "zero linear combination" is the *trivial* way ($x_m=0$)


To ask if $\vec{V}$ is in the $span\{V_1, V_2,..., V_n\}$, is to ask if we can solve $AX=B$




Just remember, if there's ONLY the trivial solution, then the vectors are **linearly independent**, cause there's always the trivial solution, there are infinite solutions when you can write a vector as a linear combination of the others.

We can think of linearly dependent sets of vectors as having some "redundancy" in them.

**Theorem**
Lets say we have m vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, 
If $m > n$, then this set must be linearly dependent (can't span a 3 dimensional space with two-dimensional vectors)


**Theorem**
Suppose $V_1, V_2, ..., V_m \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a linearly independent set 
If $V \in span\{V_1, V_2, ..., V_n\}$
Then V can be written ***uniquely*** as a linear combination of $V_1, ..., V_n$
