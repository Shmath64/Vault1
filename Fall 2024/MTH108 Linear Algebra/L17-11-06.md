$v_1$ = <1, 2, -1>, $v_2$ = <3, 0, 2>, $v_3$ = <5, 4, 0>
$V = span\{v_1, v_2, v_3\}$
V is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$
What is $dim(V)$? Find a basis of $V$

We need to put the vectors into the columns of a matrix
Let A =
```Matrix
1  3  5
2  0  4
-1 2  0
```
and when you reduce it to RREF, you get:
```Matrix
1  0  2
0  1  1
0  0  0
```
Therefore, $dim(V) = 2$

Since $v_3 = 2v_1+v_2,$
$span\{v_1,v_2,v_3\} = span\{v_1,v_2\}$

To ask if a set of vectors is a *basis*, is to ask if they're *linearly independent*.

Let A be the matrix such that:
$A = (V_1|V_2|...|V_n)$
This is linearly independent $\iff$ $AX=0$ has only the trivial solution ($X=\vec{0}$)

$AX = x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + ... + x_nv_n$
