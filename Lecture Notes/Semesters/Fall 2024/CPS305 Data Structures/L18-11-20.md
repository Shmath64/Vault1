## Heaps
(last tree algorithm, then we've got graphs!) Talking about heapsort on monday
Remember, queues are FIFO
In a *priority queue*, dequeuing an item depends on its priority.
To do this well, we can use a **binary heap** to enqueue and dequeue elements in $O(log\ n)$ time!
##### *Complete* Binary Trees
- Each level (depth) contains all nodes, except:
- The bottom level is filled left-to-right and may be "incomplete"

Two types of heaps:
1. Max-heap (largest element at root)
2. Min-heap (Smallest element at root)

For every node x with parent p, p is smaller (greater) or equal to the key in x

Heaps can be expressed as arrays:
e.g. `100 19 36 17 3 25 1 2 7`
In which `100` is the root, it's children are `19` and `36`,
- children of `19` are `17` and `3`
- children of `36` are `25` and `1`
Can think of inserting elements form the heap to the array starting at the root and doing a breadth-first search ("level-order")

### Operations on heaps:
##### HEAP-PUSH 
- Insert the item at the end of the vector (bottom level, as right as possible) and then,
- move it "up" to preserve heap ordering. (when it's smaller (larger) than its parent)
- In lisp, this will be done with the `rotatef` form (expressing the heap as an array)

**Max Heap HEAP-PUSH Implementation:**
```Lisp
(defun heap-push (node vec)
	(vector-push-extend node vec) ;insertes item at fill-pointer pos (end of array)
	(heap-up vec (1- (length vec))))

(defun heeap-up ...
```

##### Delete Max (Max-heap)
1. Remove tree root (first item)
2. Replace it with the last item in the heap array
3. Percolate that item down until finding its correct position (preserving heap ordering)
