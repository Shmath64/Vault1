## Deque
"Deque" means "Double Ended Queue"
A "hybrid linear structure that provides all the capabilities of stacks and queues in a single data structure"
- Can be traversed as FIFO or LIFO.
- **4 operators**:
	1. PUSH-FRONT
	2. PUSH-BACK
	3. POP-FRONT
	4. POP-BACK

Used in "job-stealing algorithms".

Easiest way to do this is with 2-stacks (front-stack and back-stack)

Pushing front pushes to the front-stack, and pushing back pushes to back-stack

Popping front pops from front stack, if its empty:
1. Push all from **back-stack** to **front-stack** this "reverses" the order
2. Pop from new **front-stack**

```Lisp
(defstruct deque
	front
	back)

(defun push-front (item deque)
	(push item (deque-front deque)))

(defun push-back (item deque)
	(push item (deque-back deque)))

(defun pop-front (deque)
	"If front stack is empty, pushes the items from the back stack to the front stack, then pop it"
	(unless (deque-front deque)
		(do () ;Note how this means do until (deque-back deque) is null
			((null (deque-back deque)))
			(push (pop ...) ...)))
	(pop (deque-front deque)))
```

A simple application of this is a *palindrome checker*.

```Lisp
(defun pal-checker (list)
	(do* ((d (make-deque :front list))
		(first (pop-front d) (pop-fornt d))
		(last (pop-back d) (pop-back d)))
		((not (and (equal first '[] (equal last '])))
		(and (null first) (null last)))))
```

### Sets
Each item appears only once
Unordered collection
Use case examples:
- Track items we have already seen and processed
- When we want to calculate some relations between groups of elements
**Set Interface:**
- Element-of-set?
- Insert-set, remove-set


```Lisp
(defun element-of-set? (x set)
	(when set ;Returns nil if set is '()
		(if (equal x (car set)) set ;This will return "set" of which (car set) is x
		(element-of-set? x (cdr set)))) ; Recursively then checks car of (cdr set)
```

```Lisp
(defun remove-set (x set &optional (acc ()))
	)
```


The work we're doing in this class is "declarative" not "procedural". 

#### Merge Sort
Selection sort, insertion sort and quicksort are great for arrays but not as good for lists.
Therefore we use **Merge sort** for lists

Merge sort works by recursively splitting sublists, then merging *and sorting* the sublists.

1. Split into two halves, sort them (recursively)
2. Iterate through new sorted arrays, insert into new array
