With two linear transformations, we can find the "composition" of them
$S \circ T : \mathbb{R}^n \implies \mathbb{R}^m$
$T: \mathbb{R}^n \implies \mathbb{R}^k$
$S: \mathbb{R}^k \implies \mathbb{R}^m$

'~' means "correspond"
$S$ ~ $A$
$T$ ~ $B$
$S \circ T$ ~ $AB$   <- "Multiply in same order they appear in composition statement"

"CCW": Counter Clock Wise

#### Example:
$T: \mathbb{R}^2 \implies \mathbb{R}^2$
- Rotation CCW through an angle $\pi/{2}$ followed reflection about x-axis

First part (CCW rotation):
$R_{\pi/2} : \mathbb{R}^2 \implies \mathbb{R}^2$
```Matrix
0  -1
1   0
```

Second Part (Reflection about X-axis):
$F: \mathbb{R}^2 \implies \mathbb{R}^2$
``` Matrix
1   0
0  -1
```

##### Composition:
$T = F \circ R$
("F composed of R" i.e. "R" is 'first' or 'inside')
Multiply the matrices! Result:
```Matrix
 0  -1
-1   0
```

($R \circ F$ would mean multiplying the matrices in opposite order)

To think about this geometrically, it's good to use the *standard basis vectors*

To rotate a 2D vector by theta
$R_{\theta}$ = 
```
cos0  -sin0
sin0   cos0
```


##### Onto
$T: \mathbb{R}^n \implies \mathbb{R}^m$
$T$ is called "onto" if given any $Y\in \mathbb{R}^m$ there is an $X\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $T(X)=Y$
An "onto" transformation is also called a *surjection* 

Some examples
- A $\mathbb{R}^2$ "rotation" is onto
- A $\mathbb{R}^2$ "projection onto X-axis" is NOT onto


##### One-To-One (1-1)
T is called "one-to-one" if whenever $X_1 \neq X_2$
$T(X_1) \neq T(X_2)$
Given a $T(X)$, can you find the $X$
A "one-to-one" function is also called an *injection*
This is logically equivalent to (via contrapositive):
$T(X_1) = T(X_2) \implies X_1=X_2$

Implications of 1-1:
$T(X_1) - T(X_2) = 0$
$T(X_1 - X_2) = 0$
$X_1-X_2=0$

$V=X_1-X_2$
T-linear transformation is 1-1 when $T(V)=0 \implies V=0$
##### Range
Range of $T: \mathbb{R}^n \implies \mathbb{R}^m$
$\{T(x) : x\in \mathbb{R}^n\}$

A rotation is *both* 1-1 AND onto

Some parallels and terminology:

| **Transformations**                     | Matrices                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| $T: \mathbb{R}^n \implies \mathbb{R}^m$ | $A - m$x$n$                                       |
| Composition                             | Multiplication                                    |
| Onto                                    | Consistent ($AX=Y$)<br>$rank(A)=m$                |
| 1-1                                     | $AX=0 \implies X=0$<br>i.e. ONLY trivial solution |
| Invertible                              |                                                   |

### Inverse of a transformation
A transformation T is called *invertible* if we may find *another transformation* S such that:
$S\circ T(x) = x\ ;\ T\circ S(y) = y$
A transformation is ONLY invertible if it is 1-1 and onto
