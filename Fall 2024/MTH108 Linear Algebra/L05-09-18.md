## Matrices as Mathematical Objects
Basic algebraic operations:
- **Addition**
	- Just adding each cell together?
- **Scalar multiplication**
- **Matrix multiplication**

They're just arrays of numbers arranged in rows and columns
m: rows x n: columns
$A = (a_{ij})$
$i$ tells you the row
$j$ tells you the column

Two matrices are equal if every single point in them is equivalent

##### Zero Matrices
All values are zero, can be denoted $0_{mxn}$

##### Properties of Scalar Multiplication
$c(A + B) = cA + cB$
$(c+d)A = cA + dA$
$(cd)A = c(dA)$

### Matrix Multiplication
Recall nx1 matrix is a column vector and a 1xm matrix is a row vector
We can think of matrices as a collection of vectors.

##### Matrix - (column) Vector Product
Will turn the matrix into a vector. Each cell (in this case, row) of the vector is multiplied by each column of the matrix
X = nx1
$A = (A_1 | A_2|...|A_n)$
$AX = x_1A_1 + x_2+A_2 + ... + x_nA_n$

##### Matrix-Matrix Multiplication
- A - mxr matrix
- B - rxn
- AB - mxn



Questions:
- To reach row-echelon form, must the value in the "constants vector" also be a *leading one*?
	- Nah, it's all about the coefficient matrix
