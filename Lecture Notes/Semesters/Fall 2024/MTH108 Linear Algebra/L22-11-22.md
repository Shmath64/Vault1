Continuing comparing Linear Combinations and Matrices

For a linear transformation to be invertible, it has to be BOTH **1-1** AND **onto**

If 
$AX = T(X)$ and $BX=S(X)$,
$S \circ T(X) = X$
$T \circ S(X) = X$
then:
$(BA)X = X$ therefore, $BA = I$
$(AB)X = X$

If $T$ is invertible, than $A$ is also invertible
Call $S = T^{-1}$,  Matrix $=A^{-1}$

Remember:

Reflection about X-axis:
```Matrix
1   0
0  -1
```

Remember that we can express the "standard basis vectors" as $e_n$
To go from the linear transformation to its matrix, insert each standard basis vector. Put the outputs into the columns of a matrix.

#### Image and Kernel

$T: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$
"Image of T": 
$im(T) = \{T(X) : X\in \mathbb{R}^n\}$

"Kernel of T":
$ker(T) = \{X\in\mathbb{R}^n:T(X)=0\}$
$T$ is 1-1 $\longleftrightarrow ker(T)=\{0\}$
The kernel is just the null space!

$col(A)$ means column space of A.

| Transformations | Matrices           |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Image           | $im(T) = col(A)$   |
| Kernel          | $ker(T) = null(A)$ |
|                 |                    |

### Complex Numbers Crash Course
We can think of complex numbers as a point in a plane
$Z = (X, Y)$
$X = Re(Z)$ "The *real part* of Z"
$Y=Im(Z)$ "The *imaginary* *part* of z"

Of course, we can think of the basic operations algebraically and geometrically

##### Algebraically:
$Z_1Z_2 = (X_1X_2 - Y_1Y_2,\ \ X_1Y_2 + X_2Y_1)$
Finding the inverse of a complex number: $ZZ^{-1} = (1, 0)$
Can be written as: $(ax - by, bx+ay) = (1,0)$
We can denote $Z^{-1}$ as:
	$Z^{-1} = (\frac{x}{x^2+y^2},\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2})$
##### Geometrically:
We use "polar coordinates" i.e. the length of the vector and its angle
$Z = (rcos\theta, rsin\theta)$
$|Z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
This is the **modulus** of a complex number (Not "absolute value")

**Argument** is the "principal value"
$-\pi<\theta \leq \pi$ 
i.e. $\theta \in (-\pi, \pi]$

##### Reminder: Sum of Angles Formulas
$cos(a+b) = cosa*cosb - sina*sinb$
$sin(a+b) = cosa*sinb+sina*cosb$

Using these, we can derive:
$Z_1Z_2 = (r_1r_2cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2), r_1r_2sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2))$

When we multiply 2 complex numbers:
1. We *multiply* their moduli
2. We *add* their angles!

#### Complex Conjugate
if $Z=(x,y)$, then its **complex conjugate** is:
$\overline{Z} = (x, -y)$

$Z\overline{Z} = (x+iy)(x-iy)$
$= x^2 - (i^2y^2)$
$= x^2 + y^2 = |Z|^2$

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
Only worried about square matrices

"A diagonal matrix is easy to understand. The next best thing is if A is diagonalizable"
	(note that diagonal matrices *can* have zeroes on the diagonal)

We look at this concept in the framework of complex numbers!
$z = x+iy$
$i^2 = -1$
