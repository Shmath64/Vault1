$AX=B$   ->  $(A|B)$ ; make augmented matrix and do EROs

Suppose P is an m x n invertible matrix
$AX=B$
$(PA)X=PB$


"The process of performing row operations is the same as multiplying (**on the left**) by Elementary Matrices."

When $m=n$
$AX = B$ has ==a unique solution IFF A is invertible!
$RREF(A) \neq I$ is the same as $A$ being invertible!

Remember that square matrices does not have an inverse.
$A$ is invertible -> $AB=BA=I$

An m x n matrix may have a left inverse, or right inverse but not both. ??

## Determinants
For a square $n*n$ matrix A, we define a number called "the determinant of A"

For n>2, we define det(A) recursively, the determinant of an nxn matrix is defined in terms of determinants on (n-1)x(n-1)

A=
```Matrix
a b
c d
```
$A^{-1} =$
```Matrix
```


$\frac{1}{det(A)} = det(A^{-1})$

Theorem1: 
	A is invertible IFF $det(A)\neq0$
	$A^{-1} = \frac{1}{det(A)} [\frac{a_{22}\ -a_{12}}{\ -a_{21}\ a_{11}}]$
Theorem 2: 
	$det(AB) = det(A) * det(B)$
- Therefore if A is invertible and B is invertible, then AB and BA are invertible (because it's a nonzero number multiplied by a nonzero number)
Theorem 3: 
	$det(A^T) = det(A)$

For the cheat sheet:
#### Properties of the Determinant
$\frac{1}{det(A)} = det(A^{-1})$ 
$A^{-1} = \frac{1}{\det(A)} \begin{bmatrix} a_{22} & -a_{12} \\ -a_{21} & a_{11} \end{bmatrix}$
$det(AB) = det(A) * det(B)$
$det(A^T) = det(A)$
$det(I)=1$ 

For n=3, we define det(A) by calculating the determinants of various 2x2 submatrices in A.

For n > 2 we define det(A) by calculating the determinants of various (n-1)x(n-1) submatrices in A.
