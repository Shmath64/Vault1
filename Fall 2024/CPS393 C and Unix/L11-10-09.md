#### Pointers
"Pointers" are just addresses
```C
int Num;
Num = 5;
int *NumPtr //* means pointer!
NumPtr = &Num;
printf("%d", *NumPtr); //prints 5
printf(" %p %d %d ", NumPtr, *NumPtr, Num); //1200 7 7
```

#### Macros
Hashes mean "pre-processor directives"!
`#include <stdio.h>` <-- Tells the compiler to include contents of standard input-output header file (`stdio.h`). Provides functions such as `printf()`, `scanf()`, `getchar()`, `putchar()`.

`#define MAX 10` <--Before sending to compiler, replace every `MAX` with `10`. (it's a *constant*).
- This is actually more efficient than using variables (as when the code comes across a variable, it has to fetch it from memory)

`#include <math.h>` allows you to access M_pi

###### Pre-Defined Macros
`__FILE__`: Name of the file of original soruce code
`__DATE__`: Date of compilation
`__TIME__`:
`__LINE__`:

##### Function-Like Macros
Not actually functions!
`#define ADD(x,y) x+y` <-- would replace `ADD(3,2)` with `(3+2)`
Be careful with these,
```c
#define SQUARE(x) x *x
z = SQUARE(v+3)// Will expand to `v + 3 * v + 3` (inner 3*v will be computed first)
```
