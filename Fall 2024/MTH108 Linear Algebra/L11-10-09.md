We've talked about how linear equations relate to matrices, but now we're connecting to geometry

- Linear combinations
- Linear independance
- Span
- Space?...


$\mathbb{R}$: set of real numbers
$\mathbb{R}^2$: set of ordered pairs
$\mathbb{R}^3$: set of ordered triples

One can think of $\mathbb{R}$ as a line


There are many ways of thinking of vectors,
- Geometric / physical
- Row Vectors (1xn matrix) & Column vectors (nx1 matrix)

Conventionally, we use column vectors. Books often write: $\vec{v}=(x, y, z)^T$

Vectors are quantities specified by both magnitude and direction.

"The parallelogram rule" refers to adding vectors geometrically.

Zero vector has length zero and is denoted 0.

"Analytical point of view" of vectors
- Vectors starting from origin of the cartesian plane.
- The "coordinates" of the end point are its "components"
