"With great power, comes great responsibility"

Binary Search Trees allow us to search very quickly, but we must be careful when making changes, inserting nodes, etc.

### BST-REMOVE
removes an item from BST
1. Traverse to the node that needs to be deleted
2. Once there, two cases to consider:
	1. Node to be deleted has one/no children
	2. Node to be deleted has two children

When no children, just simply remove
When one child, move that child to here

When 2 children:
1. "Copy" EITHER "the largest key on the left subtree" OR "the smallest key on the right subtree"
2. BST-REMOVE that node (it IS recursive)
3. "Paste" that node to what was removed

```Lisp
(defun bst-remove (obj bst comp)
	(when bst
		(let ((key bst))
			(l (lc bst))
			(r (rc nst))
			(cond 
				((funcall comp obj key)
					(make-node :key key :lc (bst-remove obj l comp) :rc r))
				((funcall comp key obj)
					(make-node :key key :lc l :rc (bst-remove obj r)))
				(t (bst-join l r comp))))))))

(defun bst-join (l r comp)
	"Joins 2 binary trees"
	(cond 
		((null l) r); No left subtree
		((null r) l)
		(zerop (random 2))
			(let ((root (key (bst-max l))))
				(make-node :key root :lc (bst-remove root l comp) :rc r)))
				(t (let ((root (key (bst-min r))))
					(make-node :key root :lc l :rc (bst-remove r comp)))))
```

### BST-INSERT
Will need to do *at most* one comparison at each level of the tree.
We will be doing maximum operations when the height = number of nodes

"a tree is balanced if any pair of paths from the root to a leaf have lengths that differ by some predetermined amount"

## Splay (BST) Trees
- Most recently accessed elements occur near the root.
- A sort of "self-balancing" BST, where *balanced* means recently accessed elements are near the root
- **Splaying**: when a node x is accessed, a *splay operation* is performed on *x* to move it to the root via a *sequence of sub-tree rotations*
This of course preserves the binary-tree order property.

\*\*\*Bringing a node from the **left** subtree towards the root is called a "left-tree rotation" even though this on the internet will often be called a "right-tree notation"

```Lisp
(defstruct (node (:conc-name nil)
				 (:print-object
					 (lambda (node out)
						 (format out "[~a-~@[~a~]-~@[~a~]]"
							 (key node) ; the key
							 (lc node) ; left child
							 (rc node) ; right child
							 )))))
```

doing `ST-SEARCH` will change the tree (bringing the item that was searched for to the root)

#CBH and implement this yourself! Tree-rotate and search
