#### Alternatives to DES and AES
- Blowfish was developed by B. Schneider in 1993
	- uses binary addtion, XOR function and 32 bit table lookup
	- Fits in 5KB of memory and needs 521 rounds for subkey generation
		- Not suitable for frequent key change
	- Suitable for when you can use one key for a whole session
- RC4 is a stream cipher which operates on bytes

## Blowfish
Blowfish is unpatented and license-free and free.
There have been no effective cryptanalysis of Blowfish.
- 64-bit block size and the key length ranges from 32-448 bits (default 128 bits)
- Two parts to the algorithm:
	1. Part that handles expansions of the key. Keys must be pre-computed before the encryption or decryption
	2. A part that handles the encryption of the data (16 rounds)

"Expansion of a key" means breaking the original key into a set of subkeys.
There is a P-array containing 18 instances of 32-bit subkeys
There are 4 S-boxes that contain 256 entries each.
64-bit input is denoted with an $x$ while the P-array is denoted with a $K_i$

- Output of F-Function is 32 bits
- "Output Whitening" 

This is all very fast, hardest part is computing $P_1, P_2, ... P_{18}$


It can be decrypted by doing all this backwards if you know $P_i$

#### Key Expansion
(the lengthy process of this)
1. Initialize the P-array and S-boxes (in order) with values derived from the hexadecimal digits of pi, which contain no obvious pattern
2. XOR P-array with the key bits
	1. P1 XOR (first 32 bits of key), P2 XOR (second 32 bits of key)
	2. Circle through the key until whole P-array is XORed with key bits.
3. Encrypt the all-zero string with Blowfish algorithm using Pi (digits of pi, not a float) obtained in previous step
4. Replace P1 and P2 with output of step 3
5. Modify the subkeys by XOR-ing with real key bits
6. Encrypt the new P1 and P2 with the modified subkeys P1 and P2.
7. Replace P3 and P4 with output of step 5
8. Repeat 521 times in order to calculate new subkeys for the P-array and the four S-boxes
~4KB of data is processed at the end of the day

### Feistel Network
Is a symmetric structure used in the construction of **block ciphers**.

### IDEA - International Data Encryption Algorithm
- Made because DES's key size was too small.
- IDEA is a block cipher desigend by Xuejia Lai and James L. Massey
- Minor revision of an earlier cipher, PES (Proposed Encryption Standard)
	- Initially called IPES (Improved PES)
- Operates with 64-bit plaintext and cipher blocks is controlled by a 128-bit key
- Algorithm is based on mixing operations of three algebraic functions
	- XOR
	- Addition Modulo $2^{16}$ \[drawn as box with +]
	- Multiplication modulo $2^{16} + 1$ 
- ^4-bit plaintext block is partitioned into four 16-bit sub-blocks: $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$
- Algorithm has 8 rounds

(superscript denotes the round and subkey denotes key index)

##### Key Generation Process
For the first round, from 128-bit key, eight 16-bit keys are generated
- Key is rotated 25 bits to the left and again divided into 8 subkeys
	- First 4 are used in second round, and next 4 in third round

##### Decryption
- Computational process used for decryption of the ciphertext is essentially the same as that used for encryption

##### Modes of Operation
IDEA supports modes of operation:
- Electronic Code Book (ECB) (Do NOT use small blocks) mode
- Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
- Cipher Feedback (CFB)
- Output Feedback (OFB) modes

--Conclusion--
All these algorithms are "second generation"

All this fails if keys can't be communicated or deleted securely

For very important communications, we should have a long-term "permanent key" that is used rarely and used to create and exchange session keys.
#### Unicity distance
- English alphabet, each character can convey $log_2(26)=4.7$ bits of information
- Actual redundancy reduces this to 1.5 bits per character.
