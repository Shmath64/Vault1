Magnitude of the cross product:
$|| V x U || = ||V||\ ||U||sin\theta$


The area of *the parallelogram (formed by the matrix additions)* is equal to the magnitude of the cross product.

When it comes to higher dimensions, we talk about the volume of a **parallelepiped** 
In which volume is equal to the area of base times vertical height. 


V x W is the determinant of:
```Matrix
i  j  k
V1 V2 V3
W1 W2 W3
```
In which i, j, k are the basic vectors
Cofactor expansion about row 1


Volume of a parallelopiped defined by U, V, W  is $|U * (VxW)|$
$U * (VxW) = det($
```Matrix
U1 U2 U3
V1 V2 V3
W1 W2 W3
```
)

To define a line, we need at least a slope and a point or two points.
### Planes
When we have a plane in 3D, we need at least a normal vector and a point.
With two vectors in a plane, we can take the cross product and get a "normal vector".
We can find two vectors on a plane if we have 3 points on it. (3 points doesn't necessarily determine a plane, they could be collinear)

**General form**: $ax + by + cz + d = 0$
**Point-Normal Form**: $a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0)$

When we have 3 points, we can set up a homogenous system of linear equations. This will be a 3x4 in which the variables are a, b, c, and d (which is arbitrary)

How to find equation of plane given a normal vector and point?
$\vec n = (2, 3, 1)$, and point $(1, 0 -1)$

### Lines in Space
When trying to find if a line intersects a plain, find the equation of the line and the point-normal form of the plane.
