Final will be mostly after second midterm. Probably nothing before first midterm really.
Focus on what wasn't touched for second midterm.

(Starting slide 61, program sec)
"CBAC" = Code Based Access Control
### CBAC cont.
The java virtual machine and .NET common language runtime both use call stack to manage access rights during executions

#### Assert Option
Exists in JVM and .NET, we can allow something to happen even if we don't have the permissions.
- Asserted permission will **stop** the stack walk
- Assertion allows "untrusted callers" to run a "trusted method"
	- Think low-privilege functions running higher privilege functions

#### History-based access control
- Stack walk might not work when optimizations are used during executions (important when you use recursions)
- *Tail call elimination* may open a security breach
	- If g calls f which requests permission for p, and g uses tail call elimination, its ambiguous whether f may access p
- If g() had asserted permission, it will be cancelled by overwriting g()'s frame.
- To avoid problems, we go from "lazy evaluation" to "eager evaluation" (Paradigm). 
	**Eager evaluation** keeps track of caller's access rights proactively
	Also known as **History Based Access Control** (HBAC)
Static permissions S are associated with each piece of code at load time.
Current rights D associated with each execution unit are updated automatically at execute time with rule: $D = D \intersection S$

#### Java Security
- Applets are Java programs interpreted by a virtual machine in a web browser.
- It is thus natural to let this virtual machine perform access control, constraining applets within a *sandbox*.
- In addition, the language the applets are written in, can make it more difficult to cause damage.

**Sandbox**
Think of kids playing sandboxes (all damage is contained within the sandbox).
It *is* a security mechanism for separating running programs usually in an effort to mitigate system failures and/or software vulnerabilities from spreading.
- Network access, ability to inspect the host system, or read from input devices is typically disallowed or heavily restricted.
Typical policy:
1. Applets CANNOT access file system
2. Applets CANNOT get user's information/email/hardware configuration
3. Applets can make ONLY outward connections back to the server they came from
4. Pop up windows are marked "untrusted"
5. CANNOT reconfigure JVM

### Java 2 Security model
- Implements CBAC
- Java 2 security model separates policy specification from policy enforcement.
- A security policy grants resource access permissions to code by mapping code attributes to granted permissions (Basically *reference monitor*)
- *Security manager* is the policy enforcement point is called when access to a protected resource is requested.
- Collects the relevant evidence and invokes the access controller, the policy decision point making the actual decision,

**BCV** (Byte Code Verifier) analyses Java class files, performing syntactic checks and using theorem provers and data flow analysis for static type checking to ensure that these expectations are met before the applet is executed.

**Class Loaders**
- Classes are loaded on demand as they are needed to resolve links (lazy loading)
- Class loading is delayed as much as possible to reduce memory usage and improve system response time.
Three types:
- Bootstrap class loader (deals with trusted functions, written in C, platform dependent)
- Extension class loader 
- Application class loader (user defined classes) 

Class loaders reads byte codes and assigns a **protection domain**
Protection Domains:
- Contains code source
- Performs link time checks to maintain data type safety
- Class file verifier checks if the constraints of the Java language are respected and that class files have a proper internal structure.

Each class is unique defined, a browser loads applets from different sources into **separate** class loaders.

"Security manager" is the "reference monitor" in the JVM.
To request check, the program has to call the checkPermission method of the security manager
- checkPermission further calls checkPermission method of Access Controller.

Access controller examines the execution stack and performs stack walk

## .NET Security Framework
Analogous to JVM
Main language is C# (type safe language)
- Also supports Visual basic, C++ and Visual J#
- Compiled into MSIL (**Microsoft Intermedial Language**)
- MSIL is similar to Java Byte Code
- MSIL code is sent to Just In Time (JiT) compiler just before execution.
- Assembly is a *logical unit* of MSIL code.
	- Specifies referenced assemblies, clases, classes' members, etc.

Instead of Java Loaders, we have:
**Common Language Routine (CLR)**
- Loads and executes code
- Performs security checks
- Does garbage collection
Two types of code
- Managed code is code compiled under .NET and is controlled by CLR.
- Native (unmanaged) code is code compiled to machine language for a specific hardware platform. 
	- Calls from managed code to native code are security critical and any guarantees from CLR do not apply.
	- Like the "kernel" of the virtual machine

.NET also uses code-based access control but calls it *code-identity based security* **CIBS**.
- CIBS *authorizes* code rather than users to access resources.
- *Authentication* of code identity is the process of collecting and verifying evidence about an assembly.
- Code can be classified as trusted, semi-trusted and untrusted based on the evidence.
- Evidence can be provided in two ways:
	- Host provided evidence: given by entity which launches assembly
	- Assembly provided evidence needed to authenticate the code.
		- URL of origin (very weak)
		- Hash of assembly (bit better)
		- Strong name signature, assembly's contents are hashed and signed with private key of assembly. (better)

#### Permissions
.NET has similar security considerations to Java
- Strong names create protected name spaces from different publishers.
	- "Strong Name" is private public key pair
- Assembly is digitally signed during compilation and signature is written into assembly.
- Identity based permissions can relate to publisher or zone of publishing.
