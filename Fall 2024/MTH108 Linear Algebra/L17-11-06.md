$v_1$ = <1, 2, -1>, $v_2$ = <3, 0, 2>, $v_3$ = <5, 4, 0>
$V = span\{v_1, v_2, v_3\}$
V is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$
What is $dim(V)$? Find a basis of $V$

We need to put the vectors into the columns of a matrix
Let A =
```Matrix
1  3  5
2  0  4
-1 2  0
```
and when you reduce it to RREF, you get:
```Matrix
1  0  2
0  1  1
0  0  0
```
Therefore, $dim(V) = 2$

Since $v_3 = 2v_1+v_2,$
$span\{v_1,v_2,v_3\} = span\{v_1,v_2\}$

To ask if a set of vectors is a *basis*, is to ask if they're *linearly independent*.

Let A be the matrix such that:
$A = (V_1|V_2|...|V_n)$
This is linearly independent $\iff$ $AX=0$ has only the trivial solution ($X=\vec{0}$)

$AX = x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + ... + x_nv_n$


Let A be an mxn matrix
Suppose P is  a mxm matrix. If
$B = PA$
$B = (W_1|W_2|...|W_n) = (Pv_1|Pv_2|...|Pv_n)$

For any mxn Matrix A, there is an invertible mxm matrix P such that $B = PA = RREF(A)$

Once we get RREF(A):
```Matrix
1  0  2
0  1  1
0  0  0
w1 w2 w3
```
Then we want to write the non-basic column as a linear combination of the basic columns
$2w_1+w_2=w_3$
Therefore, of the two vectors:
$2v_2 + v_2 = v_3$


If we are asked to find a basis for $\mathbb{R}^4$, and we have 3 linearly independent 4-dimensional vectors. Then we can add the 4x4 identity matrix to the right of the matrix of vectors (as columns), reduce to RREF, and then check which gives us the result we want.


Checking for Basis means showing that the vectors span and are linearly independent.
