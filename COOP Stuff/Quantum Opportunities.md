Key difference for quantum commputers
Instantiations of different computational paradigms NOT SPEED. (Quantum computers are often slower clock rates). 

National quantum strategy, three missions:
1. Computing
2. Communications (cyber security included)
3. Quantum sensing (including quantum materials)

One of the most promising use of Quantum computers is simulating quantum systems (better batteries, more efficient solar cells, etc.)
