- Final exam will be written on a *yellow* booklet
## Graphs Cont.

#### Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- Issue of efficiently transfer information about the game state to all players
	- Players must have the latest position of every other player.
- Think of the graph that is the network of all players
	- Vertices contain information about each player
	- Edges represent whether players are connected
		- Labels represent the speed of the internet connection between two players

##### Spanning Trees
A **spanning tree** for a graph $G=(V,E)$ is an **acyclic** subset of $E$ that connects **all** vertices in $V$ using $|V|-1$ edges.

The **MST** for a graph is  a spanning tree in which the sum of the weights of the edges of $T$ is minimized.

(look up Edsger W. Dijkstra)

#### Prim's Algorithm
`defun prim (G S)`: where G is a graph of S is a vertex of G
1. Let
	1. mstSet be a set containing the vertices already included in the MST.
	2. pq be a priority queue (i.e. a Min-Heap) containing the vertices not yet in mstSet
2. For each vertex $v$ in $G$
	1. insert in $pq$ a tuple `(v weight)` setting weight to be initially INFINITE
3. Assign 0 to the weight of $S$ in $pq$.
4. Sort $pq$ based on the weight of each pair `(v weight)` ; small weight value means high priority
5. While $pq$ is not empty ; build the priority queue
	1. `(pop pq)` --> `(u weight)`
	2. Include the tuple `(u wieght)` in $mstSet$
	3. For every edge <u, v> such that $v$ is not in $mstSet$
		1. If <u, v>'s weight is less than v's weight in $pq$,
			1. Update v's weight in $pq$ as <u, v>'s weight
			2. Set u as v's predecessor

When answering question about Prim's algorithm, DEFINITELY show steps

Will be given a table like so (this shows after step 2):

| Nodes | Cost     | Predecessor |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1     | $\infty$ |             |
| 2     | $\infty$ |             |
| 3     | $\infty$ |             |
| 4     | $\infty$ |             |
| 5     | $\infty$ |             |
| 6     | $\infty$ |             |
| 7     | $\infty$ |             |
(Don't need to write infinity when doing this on paper)
The $pq$ contains all the nodes and their weights, initially, the weights are infinite
3. Assign 0 to S in G
4. Sort $pq$
5. While $pq$ is not empty, build the priority queue
(checkmark denotes it was "popped" from $pq$)
After "first iteration" (Updated "costs" of nodes adjacent to 1)

| Nodes          | Cost     | Predecessor |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| $\checkmark$ 1 | 0        |             |
| 2              | 28       | 1           |
| 3              | $\infty$ |             |
| 4              | $\infty$ |             |
| 5              | $\infty$ |             |
| 6              | 10       | 1           |
| 7              | $\infty$ |             |
Here, node 1 is no longer in the $pq$ is node 6 is now the "first" in the $pq$
Now, time for second iteration, we analyse from vertex 6

| Nodes          | Cost     | Predecessor |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| $\checkmark$ 1 | 0        |             |
| 2              | 28       | 1           |
| 3              | $\infty$ |             |
| 4              | $\infty$ |             |
| 5              | 25       | 6           |
| $\checkmark$ 6 | 10       | 1           |
| 7              | $\infty$ |             |
Iteration 3 (Analysing from 5):

| Nodes          | Cost     | Predecessor |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| $\checkmark$ 1 | 0        |             |
| 2              | 28       | 1           |
| 3              | $\infty$ |             |
| 4              | 22       | 5           |
| $\checkmark$ 5 | 25       | 6           |
| $\checkmark$ 6 | 10       | 1           |
| 7              | 24       | 5           |
Always popping/analysing from the node with the lowest cost! It's a priority queue!

We then can use the table to "draw" the $MST$

Prim's Algorithm works for directed and undirected graphs
Dijkstra's Algorithm only works for directed graphs
