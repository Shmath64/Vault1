### Key Length
Short key is bad (for "brute-force"), long key is not necessarily good

Key length for public-key cryptography: not easy to figure out. 
- Typically 1024 or 2048 bits for RSA-type algorithms, smaller for elliptic curve cryptography

Dictionary attack: try common words first


### Public Key Encryption Algorithms
(Idea and first algorithm by Diffie and Hellman)
![[CPS571-L05-1.png]]
^ Where $K^+_B(.)$ is Bob's public key and $K^-_B(.)$ is Bob's private key

Cryptography uses modulus arithmetic often, as calculating modulus with discrete logarithms and square roots is difficult.

"Discrete logarithm problem":
$a^x\ mod\ n=S$
Also, **factorization** is very difficult. Also, finding **greatest common divisor** is computationally difficult.

solving $(4*x) \ mod\ 7 =1$ is equivalent to solving for x and k in $(4*x) = 7k+1$ (in which x and k are integers). Solving this is true if a has no common factors with n. 
We say that x is inverse modulo n to a:
$x=a^{(-1)}\ mod\ n$

### Totient function 
By Leonhard Euler
- Number of positive integers less than n and *relatively prime* (no common factors) to n 
(in algorithms, "n" is generally a prime number)
If n is prime, then $\phi(n) = -1$
If n is a semi prime (i.e. product of two primes p, q) it can be expressed as (p-1)(q-1):
	If $n = p*q$  then  $\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$
	e.g.
		$\phi(10) = \phi(2*5) = 4 =(2-1)(5-1)$ 
			as 1 3 7 9 are relatively prime to 10
		$\phi(21) = \phi(3*7) = (3-1)(7-1)=12$
			as 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20 are relatively prime to 21

(from youtube video)
The public key we select:
- Must be prime
- Must be less than totient
- Muse NOT be factor of the totient
The private key we select:
- product of private key and public key, divided by totient, remainder must be one. This can be expressed as:
	$(D*E)\ mod\ \phi(n) = 1$
	

##### Fermat's Little Theorem
if m is prime, and is not a multiple of m, then:
$a^{m-1} \ mod \ m = 1$


If $gcd(a, n)=1$ then they are relatively prime
Inverse number of $a\ mod\ n = a^{\phi(n)-1}\ mod\ n$


### Diffie-Hellman Algorithm for Key exchange
Computes the shared key between two parties, "*symmetric key exchange protocol*"
- Based on discrete logarithm problem
