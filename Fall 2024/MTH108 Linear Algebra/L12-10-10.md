## Geometry in Linear Algebra
"Norm" = "Length"; $||V||$
$U*V=||U||*||V||cos\theta$
$cos\theta=\frac{u*v}{||u||*||v||}$

Finding the **dot product** of U and V is the same as $U^TV$. <-- Transpose so they are compatible for matrix multiplication.

$V*V = V_1^2 + V_2^2 + V_3^2 = ||V||^2$ 
$\sqrt{V*V} = ||V||$


The "distance between" two vectors is the length of the difference between them

"Perpendicular" = "Orthogonal"
**Orthogonal IFF "dot product" = 0**

For the block on a slope question,
Given a vector W, write W as:
$W=W_{||} + W_{\bot}$
$W_{||}$ is parallel to A,
$W_\bot$ is orthogonal to A

$W_{||}=proj_a(W)$ "Projection onto a of W"
$W_\bot=W-proj_a(W)$ "Orthogonal Complement"
$W=proj_a(W)+W_\bot$

### The Cross Product
Is a vector (unlike the dot product)
Only defined in $\mathbb{R}^3$

The magnitude:
$||V$x$W|| = ||V||*||W||sin\theta$
The direction is perpendicular to the plane containing V and W and whose sense is given by the **right hand rule** (for AxB, Index is A, Middle is B, AxB is thumb; notice how BxA is the opposite direction)


#### Properties of Cross Product
$VxW = -(WxV)$ <- "antisymmetric"
$Ux(V+W)=(UxV)(UxW)$ <- "Distributive"
$(kV)xW = k(VxW) = Vx(kW)$ <- "Linearity"?
$VxV=0$



#### Coordinate description of Cross Product:
$\vec u \times \vec v = (u_2v_3 - u_3v_2)\vec i - (u_1v_3-u_3v_1)\vec j + (u_1v_2-u_2v_1)\vec k$

Questions:
- given $det(A)=det(A^T)$, can we do operations to both rows AND columns? 
	- Yeah, an equivalent determinant is an equivalent determinant. Do whatever you want.

Is he doing row operations AND column operations after expanding by c4??
