#### 1.1 Basic Elements
Memory Address Register (**MAR**) holds the next address to read/write from/to.
Memory Buffer Register (**MBR**) holds the data to read/write
Similarly,
I/O Address Register (**I/OAR**) specifies a I/O module
I/O Buffer Register (**I/OBR**) is used for the exchange of data between an I/O module and processor

A **memory module** consists of a set of locations, defined by sequentially numbered addresses. Each location contains a bit pattern that can be interpreted as either an instruction or data.
#### 1.2 Evolution of Microprocessor
Modern microprocessors are multiprocessors (also called "chips" or "sockets"). They contain multiple processors called "cores". Each core has multiple levels of memory caches.

GPUs use Single-Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) techniques.
