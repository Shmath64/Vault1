*Pipes* and *Glob Constructs* are very important!

### Pipes
doing `$ls -lt | head` "pipes" the stdout from `ls -lt` into stdin into `head`.
Can be done multiple times
`$cat AlanTuringBio80 | head -54 | tail -1` will display the 54th line of `AlanTuringBio80`

### Glob Constructs
`*` matches a string of characters
`?` matches a single character
`+(exp)` 1 or more occurrences of exp
`@(exp1|exp2|exp3)` matches one of these
###### \[...]
`[...]` matches a single char from a set of characters (where `...` is)
	`[1-58]` will match 1-5 and 8
	`[A-Za-z]` matches A-Z and a-z (single character tho)
	`!` is used as a 'not'
		`[!ABC]` means any character BUT A B or C
Also "character classes" such as:
- `[:digit:]` means `[0123456789]`
- `$ls u[[:digit:]].txt` will match ONLY ONE Digit


### Special Characters
- `\` protects the character following it from being expanded, if on the end of a line, means "continued on next line"
- `;` separates commands
- `~` Home directory name


Vim makes backup files these end in a tilde (~)


### Shell Programs (Shell Scripts) `.sh`
- Executable file containing shell 
- Can run like a program `$./programName`
```Bash
#!/bin/bash
#source: showSource.sh
#shell program to print current directory
echo -n "Current directory is: "
pwd
```

##### grep
Searches for 'patterns' in each file (recursively.)
