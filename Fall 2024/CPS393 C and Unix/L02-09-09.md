Note that `CTRL+S` freezes the terminal and `CTRL+Q` unfreezes it and then iterates through all the commands entered during the freeze!

In Linux, the starting `/` is the `root directory`
`bin` is `binary` and holds utilities that Linux can run

Most of this lecture was going over commands: [[Linux Commands]]

Note that *commands have **options***

e.g. `ls -l` shows permissions

### Linux permissions:
`r`: read, `w`: write, `x`: execute
`d` at the beginningmeans it's a directory.
These are repeated thrice for "Owner" (`u`), "Group" (`g`) and "Others/Users" (`o`). These are the letters used to assign permissions when using `chmod`, `a` means "all".


MAKE sure in your directory, that permissions for "users" are `---` (none)

``` Linux-Permission-Numerically
--- (000) 0
--x (001) 1
-w- (010) 2
-wx (011) 3
r-- (100) 4
r-x (101) 5
rw- (110) 6
rwx (111) 7
```

## Operating Systems
Are layered! They have:
### Utilities
- commands available 
	- E.g. to copy a file to another directory
### Shell
- A program that reads and executes user-inputted commands (e.g. *PowerShell*)
### Kernel
- "Heart" of the OS. Controls access to hardware, files, computer memory, 

We communicate with the **kernel** through a **shell** using **utilities**.
