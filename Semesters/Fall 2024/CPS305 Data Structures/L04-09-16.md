```Lisp
(do (var-definition*)
	(end-test result-form*)
	body form*)
```
Note that `form*` means "zero or more form" and `[form]` means "optional form"

E.g.
```Lisp
(do ((temp1 1 (1+ temp1)) ;var, init, step
	 (temp2 0 (1- temp2)))
	 ((> (- temp1 temp2) 5) temp1) ; end test and return
	 (format t "temp1: ~a tempt2: ~a~%" temp1 temp2)) ;body
```
Here, we assign temp1 and temp 2 to 1 and 0, define the "step", and the "end test" and what to to return (temp1)

## DO*
As in LET vs LET*, all initialization forms are evaluated BEFORE their values are bound to variables

Special form `values` evaluates to the forms provided.
```Lisp
(multiple-value-bind (xy) (value 'a 'b) 
	(format t "Value of x is ~a and value of y is ~a" x y))
```
