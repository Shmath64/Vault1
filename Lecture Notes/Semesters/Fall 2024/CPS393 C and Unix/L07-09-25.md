Can use `read` to read for inputs from the user.
`$read x`
`user input into the terminal` 
`$echo $x` will output "user input into the terminal"

can read multiple variables, and the default delimiter will be a space.

`while [ 0 ]` is an infinite loop since it sees it as a not-null string.

`exit 0` if everything is okay, `exit 1` if there's an error.
