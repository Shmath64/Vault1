## Sorting

### Insertion sort
The left part is already sorted, each new item is "inserted" back into the previous sublist.

\*check syntax on this:
```Lisp
(defun insertion-sort (vec comp)
	(dotimes (i (1- length vec)))
		(do ((j i (1- j))) ;Starts at i, decrements by 1
			((minusp j)) ;checks if j is negative
		(if (funcall comp (aref vec (1+ j)) (aref vec j))
			(rotatef (aref vec (1+ j)) (aref vec j))
			(return))
	vec)
```

$\sum^{n}_{i=1} i = (n^2+n)/2$
$O(n^2)$ Comparisons

### Quicksort
Famous algorithm that works in $O(n\ log(n))$
- We choose a pivot value which will help split the vector into two parts: one containing elements smaller than the pivot, and another containing those that are greater
	- The place where the pivot actually belongs (once sorted) is called **ppvt**
- Goal is to move items on the wrong side of the pivot while converging on **ppvt**
