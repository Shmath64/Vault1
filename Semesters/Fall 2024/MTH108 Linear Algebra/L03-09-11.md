### Theorem 1 
- Two linear systems of equations corresponding to two *equivalent* augmented matrixes have exactly the same solutions.
### Theorem 2
- Every matrix is equivalent to a unique matrix in RREF.

## Understanding the Types of Solutions
Solve an $m$ x $n$ linear system. Qualitatively there are 3 types of solutions
Systems are **consistent** IFF they have one or more solutions (*many* and *unique*)
Systems are **inconsistent** IFF they have no solutions (*none*)

- $m$: number of equations
- $n$: number of variables
$m$ > $n$ : over determined (too many equations); could have no, unique, or many solutions
- Although, when random, we expect no solutions
$m$ < $n$ : under determined (too few equations); never has a unique solution (many or none)
- Although, when random, we expect many solutions (is a free variable)

When $m$ = $n$, we expect a unique solution (but anything is possible)

\* Remember that "Reduced Row Echelon Form" needs zeroes above leading ones, but not necessarily all just zeroes and ones.
\* And that "Basic Variables" are leading ones and "Free Variables" can be anything (They're free!). 
\* The ==existence of *Free Variables* is satisfactory to show many solutions==

## Homogenous Systems of Equations
A homogenous system of equations is when the right-hand side is all zeros. 
$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 = 0$
$a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 = 0$

Will NEVER have no solutions - all $x$'s could be 0, this is called the "**Trivial Solution**"

### Vectors
We define "column vectors" and "row vectors"

We sometimes write solutions in vector form.
```Vector
	 / 1 \
X = |  1  |
	 \ 1 /
```
After finding a solution, you can of course plug the solution back into the equations to check your solution!
