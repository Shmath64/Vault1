$proj_u(v)$
Projection of v onto u, parallel to u, length is dot product

### Shortest Distance from a point to a line/plane
"The distance between a point and a line is the distance between the point and the closest point on a line"

When dealing with questions like this, use
- Vector algebra,
- The Pythagorean theorem, vector norms

For going to a plane, we can project onto the normal vector

## Transformations
Systems, Matrices and linear Geometry and transformations are all very related

Similar to functions, we denote transformations:
$w=T(v)$ ; looks like $y=f(x)$
We're used to functions/transformations whose inputs and outputs are real numbers, but now they're vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$

$T: \mathbb{R}^n \implies \mathbb{R}^m$
This means we have transformation $T$ and it takes an $\mathbb{R}^n$ input and has a $\mathbb{R}^m$ output
We can say t "maps" $\mathbb{R}^n$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$
$\mathbb{R}^n :$ Domain of T
$\mathbb{R}^m:$ Co-Domain of T
The image of T is:
$\{ Y\in \mathbb{R}^m : Y=TX\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$

In this course, we're only considering linear transformations. 
## When is a Transformation Linear?
A transformation is linear if given $X_1, X_2 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and scalars a, b,
$T(aX_1+bX_2) = aT(X_1) + bT(X_2)$
i.e., T "respects" linear combinations.
- T "respects" addition $T(X_1+X_2)=T(X_1)+T(X_2)$
- T "respects" scalar multiplication $T(aX) = aT(X)$

Given 
$T: \mathbb{R}^n \implies \mathbb{R}^m$ and $T$ is a linear transformation, then
T(The zero vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$) = The zero vector in $\mathbb{R}^m$

To show that something is a linear transformation, represent the inputs/outputs with variables and prove the above properties
#### Examples
$T: \mathbb{R}^1 \implies \mathbb{R}^1$ defined by: $T(x) = mx$ IS a linear transformation

$T: \mathbb{R}^1 \implies \mathbb{R}^1$ defined by: $T(x) = mx+b$ is NOT a linear transformation: $T(0) \neq 0$
- "**Affine transformation**" which is a linear transformation + a constant

$T: \mathbb{R}^2 \implies \mathbb{R}^3, T(x_1, x_2) =$ <$x_1, x_1 + x_2, x_1-x_2, 2x_1$> IS a linear transformation

We can also express linear transformations as matrices!
Using the example above, we can let: A=
```Matrix
1  1
1 -1
2  0
```
$T(X)=AX$

For every linear transformations, there is a matrix that "does the job"
