## Trees cont.
Two (main) types of traversals:
- **Depth-first search**
	- pre-order
	- in-order (only for Binary trees)
	- post-order
- **Breadth-first search**

## Depth-First Search (DFS)
#### Pre-Order
1. If the current node is empty, return
2. Execute the following three operations
	1. Visit the current node (do whatever function/check/print)
	2. Recursively traverse the current node's left subtree
	3. Recursively traverse the current node's right subtree
```Lisp
(defun pre-dfs (fn root)
	(when root ;Note that nothing happens if root is null
		(funcall fn (key root))
		(dolist (child (children root))
			(pre-dfs fn child))))
```
This will call function `fn` on every node, in pre-order DFS order
'Start at the root, do each subtree recursively'

#### Post-Order
1. If current node is empty, return
2. Execute the following three options
	1. Recursively traverse the left subtree
	2. Recursively traverse the right subtree
	3. Visit the current node <-- This at the bottom, not the top makes it post not pre 
```Lisp
(defun post-dfs (fn node)
	(dolist (child (children node))
		(post-dfs fn child))
		(funcall fn (key node)))
```

## Breadth-First Search (BFS) or "Level Order"
Visit every node on a level before going "down"
```Lisp
(defun bfs (fn nodes)
	(let ((next-level ()))
		(dolist (node (rtl:mklist nodes)) ;Traverse the level
			(funcall fn (key node))
			(dolist (child (children node)) 
			;Each child node will be pushed to the list next-level
				(push child next-level)))
		(when next-level ;If next-level not level, bfs them in order!
			(bfs fn (reverse next-level)))))
```
Application: "Crawlers" in search engines follow all links from a source page, then do the same on the current page.

```Lisp
(defun verif-tree (tree)
	(cond ((null tree) tree)
		((member (key tree) '(+ - / *)) 
		(and (verif-tree (lc tree))
			...)))))
```

**Parse (Syntax) Trees** are constructs that reflect the syntactical structure of an input language.
In Lisp, we already represent a syntax tree as a *syntax tree*

How do we specify the syntax of lisp formally?
```Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
<expr> ::= nuber | <expr> <op> <expr> | "(" <expr> ")"
<op> ::= "+" | "-" | "*" | "/"
```
Here, we see that `3/(4-2)` is syntactically correct according to the above grammar.
We can turn this into a "syntax tree"

AVOID having multiple valid syntax tress for one string!
This is called "ambiguous grammar"

The "global environment" is what holds variable bindings!

```Lisp
(defun evaluate (e env)
	(cond 
		((symbol? e) (lookup e env))
		((or (procedure? e) (numberp e)) e)
		))
```
