## Week 7 Reading Notes: Research and Citation

You will paraphrase more than you will quote. In technical writing, direct quotation is rarely used.

"Paraphrasing" means keeping the meaning, but using your own vocabulary.
Substituting just some synonyms here and there (even after citing the author) IS a kind of plagiarism.

Paraphrasing strategies:
- Use synonyms for non-generic words
- Change the structure of the sentence
- Change voice (active <-> passive)
- (Clauses <-> phrases)
- Change parts of speech

##### Peer-reviewed Journals
"Peer-reviewed", "Scholarly" and "refereed" all refer to the same thing.
These are articles written by experts and reviewed by several other experts. 
- More likely to be scientifically valid, reach reasonable conclusions, etc.
Ideally, the reviewers don't know who the author is, so the reputation of the author has no play.

##### How to determine if an article qualifies?
1. Limiting a search to peer-reviewed journals only
2. Checking the database Ulrichsweb.com
3. Examining the publication
	- Check the masthead
	- Is it scholarly, uses technical terminology, format appropriately (abstract, literature review, methodology, results conclusion and references).
4. Check the official website (see if it states)


#### Evaluating Web Sites
Determining if a website is appropriate for college-level research
Avoid out of date, inaccurate, or biased information

Consider:
- Author,
- Bias,
- Accuracy,
- Timeliness

Who has written this (do they have credentials?)? 
**Organizations as Authors**: check the organization, consider potential bias.

To verify accuracy, compare information with other sources on the topic (good if the website gives you its sources)

.com (commercial)
.org (non-profit organization)
.gov (government)
.edu (educational institution)
.net (Web infrastructure, business)
.mil (military)

#### Citations
Identifying the sources you've quoted, paraphrased or otherwise used.  
Many different styles, most common are Chicago, MLA, APA and CSE
First acknowledge a source after using it, and include more information in a Bibliography.
