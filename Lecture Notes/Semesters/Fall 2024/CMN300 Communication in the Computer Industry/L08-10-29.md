## Week 8 Reading Notes:

### Definitions
"Definitions are common in communicating policies and standards 'for the record'".
They also:
- Clarify a description of a new development/new technology
- Help specialists communicate with less knowledgeable users
Three types of definitions:
1. Parenthetical
2. Sentence
3. Extended

*Stipulative Definitions* stipulate exactly how a term is used in a document

be specific in stating the category and distinguishing characteristics

An *Extended Definition* is a detailed explanation of one or more paragraphs

An *Analogy* is a special kind of comparison

A definition is typically placed in one of the following locations:
- In the text
- In a marginal gloss
- In a hyperlink
- In a footnote
- In a glossary
- In an appendix

### Descriptions
Ensure you're clear on how general/specific a thing you're trying to describe
- Indicate the nature and scope of the description
- Provide appropriate detail

### Instructions
- What are your readers' expectations?
- Do you need to create more than one set of instructions for different audiences?
- What languages should you use?
	- Simultaneous or sequential?
- Will readers be anxious about the information?
- Will the environment in which the instructions are read affect the document design?

To create clear, attractive pages,
- Create an open, airy design
- Clearly relate the graphics to the text

Readers' safety should be \#1 priority
Sometimes a phrase works better than a sentence: "Safety Glasses Required"

**Signal Words**:
- Danger
- Warning
- Caution
- Note

##### Drafting Steps
- Number the instructions (and include two-level numbering when helpful)
- Present the right amount of information in each step
- Use the imperative mood ("fasten the bolt too...")
- Do not confuse steps and feedback statements (don't number "the system will now update your information")
- Include graphics when appropriate
- Do not omit articles to save space ('a', 'an', 'the')

### From the video:

How?
- Chunk and number the steps
- Show one action for each step
- use imperative voice
- Use text-visual information


## In-Class Section

Defining Terms and Concepts:
1. Parenthetical
2. Sentence

#### Parenthetical
- Simplest form of definition
- Unfamiliar terms briefly defined in parentheses after term
- Define unfamiliar words using familiar words
- Do it once, then you're good to go and can use the term as much as you want.
- **Acronyms and Initialisms** (Acronyms are pronounceable (e.g. NASA), initialisms are when you say the words (e.g. FBI))
	- Preferred to spell out the whole words FIRST and put the acronym in parentheses after.
**Clarifying Definitions**
- Do NOT define with metaphors or figurative language, negation, or opposition
- Not meant to be comprehensive, not needed to be "perfect"

#### Sentence Definitions
- Term - class - differentia
- e.g. "An **anemometer** (term) is an **instrument** (class) used **to measure wind velocity** (differentia)"

#### Mistakes To Avoid:
- *Tautology* (repetition or circular reasoning)
- Beginning with "when", "what" or "where"
- Over-specificity
