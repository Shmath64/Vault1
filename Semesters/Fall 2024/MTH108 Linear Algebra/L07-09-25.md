To find $A^{-1}$, make augmented matrix: $(A|I)$ so that the identity matrix is on its right, and then convert A to RREF and the matrix on the right is now $A^{-1}$.

If $RREF(A)$ is NOT the identity matrix, then A is NOT invertible. This means there can't be a unique solution (Can be many or none)

### Properties of the Inverse
A is a $n*n$ matrix.
Powers of A:
$A^0 = I$
$A^1 = A$
$A^2 = A*A$
$A^3 = A^2*A$ 
$A^3 = A^3*A$ 

*When A is invertible* we define:
#### Properties of Invertible Matrices
$A^{-k} = (A^{-1})^k$
- $A^{-1}$ is invertible
- $A^k$ is invertible
- $(cA)^{-1} = c^{-1}A^{-1}$
- $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$
- $A^T$ is invertible: $(A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T$
- If $B$ is also invertible, then $A*B$ is invertible.


##### Elementary Matrices
Are just matrices obtainable by doing an elementary row operation on $I$

Multiplying the elementary matrix with another matrix, A, is the same as doing that elementary row operation on A

We can multiply multiple elementary matrices together ("compound" them) and this can represent a bunch of EROs. Multiplying this "compound" matrix by $A$ will have the same effect of doing all the same EROs (in the same order)

All Elementary matrices are invertible!

$(A\ |\ I)$
$...$ Reduce A to RREF
$(RREF(A)\ |\ P)$
$PA=RREF(A)$

"The cumulative effect of row operations is the same as the product of the elementary matrices"

To solve AX = B we can multiply each side by $A^{-1}$ ONLY if A is invertible. If it isn't it may still have a solution
