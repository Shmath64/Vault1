`find` command will locate files and directories for you.
`$ find /home/dwoit -name "*.jav"` <- Find under `home/dwoit` where the name matches the pattern `"*.jav"`

Find can also be used with '-type' to search for say, just directories, we can also use '-perm' to check for permissions

`cut` command can be used to pick "fields" out of "tabfiles". or you can define your own delimiter.
