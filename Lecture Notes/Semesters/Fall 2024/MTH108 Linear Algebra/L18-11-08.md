Given an mxn matrix A
col(A) = span of columns of A
"**Column space**" is the span of the columns of A while,
"**Row Space**" is the span of the rows of A
The difference is just are we treating the rows or columns of A as vectors

$col(A) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$
$row(A) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$

**Null Space** 
$null(A) = \{X \in \mathbb{R}^n, AX=0\}$

The rank of an mxn matrix A
We start with A, do the row operations to get RREF.

The "leading ones"/"basic ones" we can count, this is $rank(A)$
The rank can never be more than min(m, n)
$rank(A) \leq m$
$rank(A) \leq n$
$rank(A) \leq min(m,n)$

We want to find a basis for / find dimension of:
col(A)
row(A)
null(A)

We can say that:
$col(A) = span\{v_1, ..., v_n\} = span\{$basic columns of A$\}$
$dim(col(A)) = rank(A)$

$row(A) = span\{v_1, ..., v_n\} = span\{$basic rows of A$\}$
$dim(row(A)) = rank(A)$

Remember that row operations do NOT change the span of the rows of a matrix

When a set of vectors has the zero vector, it CANNOT be linearly independent!
Think of:
$0<1, 0, 2> + 0<3, 1, 1> + 15<0,0,0> = <0, 0, 0>$
That's a non-trivial solution!

While the row space and column space are different things, they're dimensions are equal
Of course,
$col(A^T) = row(A)$, thus, $rank(A)=rank(A^T)$

**Null Space**:
$null(A) = \{X\in\mathbb{R}^n:AX=0\} =$ all solutions to the homogenous system of equations

For RREF(A)=
```Matrix
1  0  2
0  1  1
0  0  0
```
$A[x_1,x_2,x_3]^T = 0$
We see that $x_1, x_2$ are basic variables and $x_3$ is a free variable

Lets solve basic variables in terms of free variables
$x_1 = -2x_3$
$x_2 = -x_3$
We see that:
$X = t[-2, -1, 1]^T ; t\in\mathbb{R}$
$null(A) = span\{[-2,-1,1]^T\}$
$dim(null(A)) = 1$

We can always find a basis for the null space, takes a bit more work, the *recipe* is:
1. Find RREF of A
2. solve for free variables in terms of basic variables
3. Write solutions AX=0 in Vector Form

**nullity** 
The "nullity" is equal to n (number of equations) minus r (rank)
$nullity = dim(null(A)) = n-r$

### Rank + Nullity:
For mxn matrix A
$rank(A) = nullity(A)$
The following are equivalent (all true, or none):
**Theorem 1:**
1. $rank(A)=n$
2. $row(A)=\mathbb{R}^n$
3. The columns of A are independent
4. If $AX=0$ then $X=0$

**Theorem 2**:
1. $rank(A)=m$
2. $col(A)=\mathbb{R}^m$
3. The rows of A are independent
4. $AX=B$ always has a solution
