#### SED (Stream Editor)

`sed -e "s/linux/LINUX myfile...`
	Note: including `myFile` feeds the file contents into the command
changes `linux` to `LINUX`
This is equivalent to: `sed -e 's/linux/\U&` for uppercase
Uses regex, so you can do stuff like:
`sed -e 's/xx*/1234` <-- changes examples of one or more x's to `1234`
	adding `/g` at the end makes it "global"

"Just the tip of the iceberg"
Can also be used to delete lines:
	`sed -e '/[dD]ave/ d` Deletes lines containing 'Dave' or 'dave'

#### TR (Translate)

`tr ":" ";"` \#changes all colons to semicolons

It does understand ranges, so you can do stuff like:
`tr "A-Z" "a-z"`
`tr "a-z" "123"` \#changes a to 1, b to 2, c-z to 3
`tr -d` will delete
`[:punct:]` is punctuation, `[:blank:]` are spaces


### Bash as a Programming Language
Environment Variables are denoted with `$`:
`env` checks environment variables

Just within the terminal, you can do: `fn=Matthew` and then `echo $fn` and it'll print `Matthew`
`echo ${#fn}` will print the length of what's stored in `fn`
 
Declaring an integer can be done like:
`declare -i x=1` \# declares variable x as 1 and of type integer
Important to declare integers if you want to do any kind of math
Or, you could do arithmetic in `$(( ))`
There *is* a way to get bash to use floating-point but not needed for the class.


##### if
```Bash
#This checks if fname is a file AND (-a) if user has x permissions
if [-f fname -a -x fname ] ; then
	echo fname is an executable file
else
	echo fname ain\'t an executable file
fi #ends the "if block"
```

Null strings are false, strings with anything in it is true
Therefore, to check if something is in a file, we can use grep to see if it grabs anything.
#CBH and practice conditionals in BASH!

##### for
```Bash
for i in aa bbbb cccc d; do
	echo value of i is: $i
done
```
Will output: aa \\n bbbb \\n cccc \\n d

Just `for i` is the best way to loop over command line args one at a time.
`for file in *` will loop through all files
