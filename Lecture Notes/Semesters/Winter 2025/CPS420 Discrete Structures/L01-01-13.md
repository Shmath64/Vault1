## 1.1A Sequences - Definitions and Examples

Idea of *induction*: take a problem, and break it into 2 or more identical subproblems

A sequence is a function whose domain is either: 
- all the integers between the two given integers (finite sequence)
- all the integers greater than or equal to a given integer (infinite sequence)
(note that these integers are usually non negative)

#### Notation
"Terms" of the sequence ($a_0$, $a_1$, ...) where the number is the "position"

Sequences can be defined **analytically**, by giving an explicit formula for the nth term
Each term must be computed in a *constant finite number* of steps.

Sequences can be defined **recursively**
e.g.
Initial Conditions:
$$
b_0=1, b_1=2 \
$$
Recurrence Relation:
$$
b_k=b_{k-1} + b_{k-2}, for\ any\ k \ge2
$$

Analytical vs Recursive Definitions of Sequences
In both cases:
- The definitions are unambiguous
- Each term can be computed in a finite number of steps
However:
- When sequences are defined **analytically**, calculating the value of any term takes **constant time**
- When sequences are defined recursively, the cost of calculating the values of the sequence increases for each term as it requires the calculation of the values of all the terms before them.

Sometimes it is easier to define a sequence recursively

#### Tower of Hanoi
Questions:
1. How are the disks going to be moved?
2. How long will it take to move them?

Assume you can move k disks from one pole to another, how do you move k+1?

T(k) = cost of moving k disks from one pole to another. = number of moves of one disk from one pole to another

Recursive definition of T:
$T(1) = 1$
For $k \ge 1$
$T(k+1) = T(k) + 1 + T(k)  = 2T(k)+1$

#### Fibonacci
F(0)=1
F(1)=1
F(k) when $k \ge 2$
F(k) = "rabbits who were alive last month + new born rabbits"
=F(k-1) + "parents of newborn rabbits"
=F(k-1) + "rabbits who were alive 2 months ago"
=F(k-1) + F(k-2)

F(k)/F(k-1) approaches the golden ratio as k approaches infinity

## 1.1B Solving Recurrence Relations
Technique for solving recurrence relations called *iteration*

Transforming a recursive definition into an analytical definition is called "**Solving the recurrence relation**"
#### Notation Review:
If a is a sequence, and m and n are integers such that $m\le n$

Sum: ("The sum from i-equals-m to n of a-sub-i")
$$
\sum^n_{i=m} a_i= a_m + a_{m+1} + ... + a_n 
$$
---
Product: ("The product from i-equals-m to n of a-sub-i")
$$
\prod^n_{i=m} a_i= a_m \times a_{m+1} \times ... \times a_n 
$$
---
Union:
$$
\cup^n_{i=m} a_i= a_m \cup a_{m+1} \cup ... \cup a_n 
$$
	e.g.
	$\cup^5_{i=1}\{i\} = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$
---
Intersection:$$
\cap^n_{i=m} a_i= a_m \cap a_{m+1} \cap ... \cap a_n $$
	e.g.
	$\cap^5_{i=1}\{i\} = \varnothing$
---
Conjunction:$$ 
\land^n_{i=m} a_i= a_m \land a_{m+1} \land ... \land a_n $$
	e.g.
	$\land^5_{i=1}(i<i^2) = False$ ; as $1$ is not less than $1^2$

---
Disjunction (OR):
$$ 
\lor^n_{i=m} a_i= a_m \lor a_{m+1} \lor ... \lor a_n 
$$
---
Integration:$$
\int^b_a f(x)dx = lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\sum^n_{i=1}(\frac{b-a}{n})f(a+i\frac{b-a}{n})$$
This is the limit ($lim_n\rightarrow \infty$) of the sum ($\sum^n_{i=1}$) of widths $(\frac{b-a}{n})$ times height: $(f(a+i\frac{b-a}{n}))$

--- 
#### Iteration (Method for "solving" recurrence relations)
Remember that "solving" in this context means turning a recursive definition of a sequence into an *analytical definition* (which is an *explicit formula* such that the cost of calculating the value of *any* term of the sequence is *constant*)

**Steps of iteration**:
Given a recursively defined sequence $a_n$
1. Look at $a_0, a_1, a_2, ...$ until a pattern emerges
2. Pattern will often not be visible in the final values but in intermediate calculations instead.
3. Guess a formula for $a_n$ and prove it is equivalent to the recursive definition 

### Basic Sequences and their Solutions
##### Arithmetic Sequences
A sequence is called an **arithmetic sequence** iff
$\forall k \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists c \in \mathbb{R},\ a_k = a_{k-1} + c$ ; it is **linear**!

e.g.
Recursive Definition:
	$D(1)=100$
	$D(k) = D(k-1)+200$ for $k>1$ 
Analytical Definition:
	$D(k) = 100 + 200(k-1)$ for $k>1$
We can "solve" the recursive definition by using a **change of variable**
These means incorporating the "base case" (here it's $D(1)=100$) with the "recursive definition" and removing $D(k-1)$ 


##### Geometric Sequences
e.g. Compounding Interest
We're doing products, not sums
A sequence is called a **geometric sequence** iff
$\forall k \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists b \in \mathbb{R},\ a_k = b\cdot a_{k-1}$ ; **exponential growth**
The solution will look like:
$a_n = a_0\cdot b^n$ 
^ This makes the exponential growth obvious, probably good to remember these equations
##### Sums of Geometric Sequences
e.g. number of steps for Towers of Hanoi
$\exists b,c,$ such that $a_k=b\cdot a_{k-1}+c$ ; still **exponential growth**
Notice that the constant C will be added at every "step"

The final solution must not have a $\Sigma$ - this is NOT constant time.
