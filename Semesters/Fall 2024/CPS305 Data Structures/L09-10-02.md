## FIFO and LIFO

### Queue (FIFO)
"Simplest way to implement scheduling mechanisms"
- Printing queues
- OS control processes
- Customer service lines

There is a **head** (the one served) and the **tail** (where things enter)
	Can be done with arrays and lists in Lisp. (lists aren't as efficient)

**Enqueue** is adding an element (insert in the array and move the tail "forward")
**Dequeue** is removing an element (moving head "forward")
"Enqueue (write) to tail, and Dequeue (read) from head!"

### Stack (LIFO)
**Push** and **Pop** are both already existing forms in Lisp. Therefore, in Lisp, you can just
```Lisp
(defvar *stack* '())
```
Then push and pop to it
