### El Gamal Cryptosystem
Taher El Gamal.
Based on discrete logarithm problem, very similar to Diffie Hellman.

This protocol is for continuous "conversation".

$p = g^k \ mod \ p$
In which k is related to private key, a is related to public key and g is the "generator"
g is called "generator" since adding multiples of g to  $g\ mod\ p$ can generate all integers between 0 and p-1.

- Choose prime number p
- Solutions known for small p, so p must be large

Important for p-1 to have at least one large factor. (Not a big problem since primes are odd)
$1 < g < p$
$1 < k_p < p-1$
$y = g^{k_{priv}}$ 
Public key = (p, g, y)

Ciphertext is comprised of the private key and message, m, $my^k\ mod\ p$

Need to generate a random number for each block.

#CBH Check inverse modulo and how it relates to the El Gamal Cryptosystem

If the integer k is used twice, and an attacker has plaintext for first of those messages m1, deciphering the other m2 is easy because:
- Attacker keeps c1,1 = g^k mod p heard from past message
- And checks if it is the same as c2,1 ;  p and g are known
- Then attacker uses c1,2 which renders c12/m1 = y^k mod p
- Attacker has received also c2,2 = m2y^k mod p and computes:
	- m1 = (c2,2 / (c1,2 / m1)) mod p


## RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman)
- Exponentiation cipher
- Relies on the difficulty of determining the number of numbers relatively prime to a large integer n
	- i.e. it relies on the factoring problem and discrete logarithm problem

Maths behind RSA:
- Fermat's little theorem
- Euler generalization of Fermat's little theorem

Note: $\phi(xy) = \phi(x)*\phi(y)$

##### Algorithm
Choose two large prime numbers: p, q (secrets)

- Let $n = pq$ then $\phi(n)=(p-1)(q-1)$ <-- Also secret
- Choose encryption (public key) e < n such that e is relatively prime to $\phi(n)$
- Compute decryption (private) key d such that;
	- $ed\ mod\ \phi(n)=1$  i.e.  $d=e^{-1}\ mod\ \phi(n)$
	- $d = e^{\phi(\phi(n))-1}\ mod\ \phi(n)$

Encipherment: $c = m^e\ mod\ n$

Decipherment: $m=c^d\ mod\ n = (m^e \ mod\ n)^d\ mod\ n = m^{ed}\ mod\ n$
and since ed can be expressed as: k$\phi(n)+1$
$m^{k\phi(n)+1}$ ... #CBH 


Interesting RSA Property:
$K^-_B(K^+_B(m)) = m = K^+_B(K^-_B(m))$

Note that:
$(m^e\ mod\ n)^d = (m^d\ mod\ n)^e$

RSA can be attacked by guessing (p-1)(q-1)
Exponentiation in RSA is computationally intensive, based in software not hardware
DES/AES are at least 100 times faster

Use public key crypto to establish secure connection, then establish second key - symmetric session key - for encrypting data.

RSA Keys are much longer than keys in Symmetric algorithms

Generalization of RSA - 
Multiple key public key cryptography, MK-RSA.

Trusted third party is needed to verify the signature with public key $K_3$
1. Alice signs M and sends it to Bob: $M' = M^{k1}$
2. Bob can recovery M from M' as: M=
