#### Digital Signatures
- Authenticates both the origin and contents of the message to a third party.
- Verifiable, non-forgeable, non-repudiable.
- Non-reusable. It is a function of the document (non-transferrable)

Alice sends `m || { m } k` to Bob (where k is a symmetric key). This is NOT a digital signature because either of them could have signed it.

"Classical" digital signatures.
Think of Cathy as the trusted "lawyer"
- Alice and Bob each share keys with trusted third party, Cathy.
- Alice sends $\{m\}k_{alice}$ to Bob
- Bob sends $\{m\}k_{alice}$ to Cathy
- Cathy sends $\{m\}k_{bob}$ to Bob

#### Attacks against Digital Signatures

- Never sign documents you haven't seen
- Sign the hash, NOT the document!
- Sign message BEFORE encryption!

RSA encryption is beginning of so-called "homomorphic" encryption where you CAN do operations on encrypted text.


$(m_1^{db} mod\ n_B)(m_2^{db}mod\ n_b) = ((m_1m_2)^{db}mod\ n_b)$

One can do a digital signature based on El Gamal

"Subliminal messages" refers to hiding messages in innocuous ones.
