Final exam will have C, C++, and Linux
Same emphasis (C & C++) as Linux
Probably all be coding questions!
Need to compile working code!
No "what does this program do?"

Will have 
- `bash-cheat-sheet.txt`
- `C-cheat-sheet.txt`
- `Cpp-cheat-sheet.txt`

For questions that involve modifying XXXXX, do NOT modify anything else!
If the X's are on their own line, it's okay to turn that into multiple lines.

Creating a makefile will not be on the exam.
If practice test is easy, exam will be easy.

Review `HERE documents` (for getting inputs from stdin)
