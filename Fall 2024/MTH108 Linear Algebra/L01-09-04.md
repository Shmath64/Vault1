We emphasize the "**linear**" in "linear algebra"
The challenge is the concepts involved and their interrelationships

Core Domains:
- **Systems of linear Equations**
- **Matrices**
- **Geometry (linear)**
- **Transformations**
Ideas in one domain may be translated into another.

A "2 x 2" system refers to 2 equations with 2 unknowns/variables (synonymous in this course)
3 types of "solutions":
1. Many solutions
2. Unique solution
3. No solution
When solving, it's a bit better to multiply to match coefficients then add/subtract the equations.

## Higher Dimensions
It becomes inefficient to solve systems of linear equations (solving for one variable at a time and substituting) when you have more than by a 2x2 equation.

(Note: Sometimes called "Gauss" and sometimes "Gaussian"; same thing)
Gauss Elimination

Another way to do this is use a matrix:
`x + y + z = 7`
`2x - y + 3z = 12`
`-x + 3y + z = 9` 
becomes:
```Augmented-Matrix
 1   1   1 | 7
 2  -1   3 | 12
-1   3   1 | 9
```
It's sometimes called an "augmented" matrix because of the matrix and the other vector (on the right side). 

^We don't need the variables, use matrix notation, rows of matrix correspond to the equations.
We can perform 3 row operations: (AKA ==*Elementary Row Operations*==)
1. **Switch 2 rows**
2. **Multiply a row by a non-zero constant**
3. **Add a multiple of one row to another**

A system is said to be "inconsistent" if there are no solutions!


Looks like: (red is operations)

#### Gauss Elimination with Back Substitution
Don't need to get it down to just ones, as long as you can bring the value "up" the rows and solve for each equation.
![[MTH108-L01-3.png]]

#### Gauss-Jordan Elimination
Similar process but uses *reduced row-echelon form*

An augmented matrix is in ==***row-echelon form***== if:
1. All nonzero rows are above any rows of zeroes
2. Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entries of any row above it
3. Each leading entry of a row is equal to one

It's in ==***reduced row-echelon form***== if it's in *row-echelon form* AND
4. All entries in a column above and below a leading entry are zero

Note that this *is* in *reduced row-echelon form*:
```Augmented-Matrix
1 0 0 5 0 | 0
0 0 1 2 0 | 0
0 0 0 0 1 | 1
0 0 0 0 0 | 0
```

We will:
- solve *m* x *n* systems of linear equations
- learn the techniques of Gauss Elimination with back substitution / Gauss-Jordan Elimination
- solve our equations in matrix form
- learn the various concepts that relate these topics

*m*: number of equations
*n*: number of variables

We use subscripts to denote our variables; **double subscripts to denote coefficients** (for row and column)

==Pivot position== highlighted, so are the leading coefficients in lower rows but only in row-echelon form
 ==1==   1   1 | 7
 2  -1   3 | 12
-1   3   1 | 9


## *The algorithm* (txtbk: pg.21)

For mechanical gaussian elimination:
1. Starting from the **left**, find the first nonzero column (***Leading Element***), switch rows to put it on top! This will be the current pivot column and position
2. Use row operations to make the entries below the current pivot position equal to zero
3. Ignoring row continaing current pivot position and rows above, repeat steps one and 2 until there are no rows left
4. Divide each nonzero row by the value of its leading entry, so that the leading entry becomes 1. The matrix will then be in row echelong form.
		For going to reduced row-echelon form (For Gauss-Jordan elimination):
5. Moving from right to left, use row operations to create zeros in the entries of the pivot columns which are above the pivot positions.
