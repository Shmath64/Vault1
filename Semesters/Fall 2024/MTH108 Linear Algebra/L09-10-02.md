#### Determinants

1. A is invertible IFF $det(A) \neq 0$
2. $det(AB) = det(A)det(B)$
3. $det(A^T) = det(A)$
$A^{-1} = \frac{1}{det(A)}$

Formula for 3x3 matrix looks something like this: (DO NOT Memorize) INCOMPLETE
$det(A) = a_{11}a_{22}a_{23} + a_{12}a_{31}a_{33} + a_{13}a_{21}a_{32} - (a_{11}a_{11}a_{11} + a_{x}a_{x}a_{x} +a_{31}a_{31}a_{22})$

$det(I)=1$

Elementary Row/Column Operations
Can use E(R/C)O's to simplify finding the determinant!
- Row swapping changes the sign of the determinant
- Scaling a row by a constant scales the determinant by that constant (so to keep the determinant the same, multiple by one over that constant)
- Adding a multiple of one row to another does NOT change the determinant!

Can do operations on columns as well as rows! All the same in determinants.

The **adjoint** / **adjugate** of A $adj(A)$ 
If $A = (a_{ij})$ is a $n*n$ matrix, we may find n^2 cofactors $c_{ij}$, one for each element $a_{ij}$ ... #CBH 

Theorem:
for any nxn matrix, $A*adj(A) = adj(A)A = det(A)I$
