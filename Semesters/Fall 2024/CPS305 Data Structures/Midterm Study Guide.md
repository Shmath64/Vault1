The midterm test will be held in person and completed using paper and pencil (B or higher graphite hardness). It will cover material from Chapters 1 through 6 of the textbook, as well as lecture slides from Weeks 1 to 5. The test will consist of 7 questions, each roughly equally weighted. The questions will include theoretical problem-solving, coding (in Lisp), and multiple-choice or short-answer formats.

To do well on the test, you should be able to do the following:

**Basic Lisp programming**:

1. Describe and write Lisp expressions that combine the following programming elements to create abstractions
    1. Primitive expressions
    2. Means of creating functions
    3. Variable binding
    4. Quote vs Eval
    5. Branching
    6. Recursion (as seen in various programs we analysed from weeks 1 to 5, inclusive)
    7. Loops using DOTIMES, DO, and DOLIST

**Algorithm Analysis**:
1. Algorithm analysis
    1. Describe why algorithm analysis is important.
    2. Obtain the order of magnitude (aka order of growth) of a function
2. Use “Big-O” to describe an algorithm’s time complexity 

**Implementation of basic data structures**:

1. Write programs that use static one-dimensional arrays
2. Write programs that use Lisp lists
3. Describe the abstract data type list as a linked list using the node and reference (aka "cons cell") pattern, implement that data structure in Lisp, and write programs that use it.
4. Write programs that process lists as sets.

**Searching and Sorting**: explain and implement the following algorithms and describe their time complexity:

1. Sequential search
2. Binary search
3. Selection sort.
4. Insertion sort.
5. Merge sort
