6 Weeks to do

Basic summary:
We have to determine whether and how to use AI in the company's hiring process.
- What can AI do
- Potential privacy problems
- potential ethical concerns (e.g. bias)
- Effectiveness for the company (e.g. hiring, cost, time effectiveness)

Then we must recommend what the company should do.

Report should be 6-12 single-spaced pages (excluding title page, table of contents, list of figures, references, images, graphs, charts and appendices)

Must be appropriate for secondary audiences

Monday Dec 2, recommendation report due (25%)

Any assignment that references a source that doesn't exist automatically gets a zero.


- What types of AI-assisted hiring exists? Is it better or worse?
- What legal responsibilities does the employer have? (bias? disabilities?)
- How much will it cost? Cost effectiveness?
- Privacy concerns?
- Security concerns?
- Is it universally accessible?
- Ethics? Equitable?

Look for what's been happening to companies using AI in the hiring process.
Recommendations don't need to be all or nothing.

The report must be accessible to read at every level of the company.

2. Table of Contents
