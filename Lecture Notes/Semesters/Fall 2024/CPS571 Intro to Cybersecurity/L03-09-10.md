## Authentication
*Are you who you say you are?*
Is proving some kind of identity to some entity. 
Internet can make it very hard.

Authentication is becoming more and more automated (many we can't see)

### Session Authentication
With web servers; authenticates the *continuity* of a particular conversation (easy face-to-face, hard over the Internet)
### Transaction authentication
whether a transaction is valid (for all parties involved)
## Integrity
Is the data really the data the source sent?
Violated by **man-in-the-middle** attacks.

### Auditing
Double-entry bookkeeping where each transaction debits one and credits another account (known since 1500s) is a form of **audit**. It allows early detection of mistakes and reduces the likelihood of fraud.
Audit cannot prevent an attack, but it can detect a successful attack, figure out what happened and prove it later.
You do your own auditing when exchanging bitcoin.

Time for Classical Cryptography!

Cryptography is the **core technology** of cyberspace. This course will focus on the ramifications of cryptography more so than the math (but the math is helpful to know)

The oldest application of cryptography is:

## Encryption
prevents "secrets" from being read without someone with private knowledge.

5 "ingredients":
- Plaintext
- Encryption algorithm
- Secret key (or keys): in symmetric key encryption all keys are secret.
- Ciphertext
- Decryption algorithm

"Symmetric (single) key" involves only secret keys
"Asymmetric (two-keys, or public-key encryption)" involves secret and public keys

Symmetric key algorithms do bit operations on registers and are extremely fast. Symmetric keys are **identical** for sender and receiver! 

AES is the "new & cool" DES

We use public key cryptography to protect secret keys!

**Security depends on the secrecy of the *KEY* NOT THE *ALGORITHM***
Algorithm typically not a secret.

#### Cryptosystem
Quintuple (E, D, M, K, C):
- M set of plaintexts
- K set of keys
- C set of ciphertexts
- E set of encryption functions: e: M x K -> C
- D set of decryption functions d: C x K -> M

Cryptography mainly provides confidentiality (but indirectly integrity)

Example: Caesar Cipher
M = { sequences of letters } 
K = { i | i is an integer and 0 <= i <= 25}
E = { Ek | k element of K and for all letters m, Ek(m) = (m+k) % 26 }
D = { Dk | k element of K and for all letters c, Dk(c) = (26 + c - k) % 26 }
C = M


the **Adversary** is the one who's trying to break the encryption. Assume adversary knows the algorithm used (public) but not the key (private).

Three types of attacks in decreasing order of difficulty:
- Ciphertext only: adversary has only cipher text
- Known plaintext: adversary has ciphertext and corresponding plaintext
- Chosen plaintext: adversary may supply plaintexts and obtain corresponding ciphertext; goal is to find key

Real attacks generally don't break cryptography.

- Mathematical attacks
	- Based on analysis of underlying mathematics
- Statistical attacks
	- Make assumptions about the distribution of letters, pairs of letters (digrams), triplets of letters (trigrams) etc. (in plaintext)
	- This only works if each letter is encrypted independently (**monoalphabetic cipher**).

## Classical (Symmetric) Cryptography
Sender (Alice) and receiver (Bob) 
$D_K = E^{-1}_{k}$  or $m = D_k(E_K(m))$

Two basic types of symmetric ciphers:
- **Transposition Ciphers**
	- Key is some permutation (changing order of characters) function over the message
- **Substitution Ciphers**: substitution one thing for another
	- There should be table of mapping as key e.g. **monoalphabetic cipher** (each letter maps to another)
- **Product Ciphers** are a combination of transposition and substitution

### Vigenère Cipher
Vigenère cipher uses a sequence of keys represented by a string (poly-alphabetic cipher)
Uses a string where each letter is its own "little" caesar shift for that letter. The randomly generated key should be at least the length of the message.

We can make this more sophisticated by using *n* substitution ciphers, M1, M2 ... Mn
Now, ecnryption key in this case is composed of *n* substitution ciphers and cyclic pattern key is not just n-bit pattern. 

**Stream ciphers** where each letter is independently enciphered and **block ciphers** where whole message or large part of it is enciphered as stream of bits.
# DES: Data Encryption Standard
Data Encryption Standard (DES) is NOT used today, but laid the theoretical and practical groundwork for many other ciphers.
- A **block cipher** encrypts blocks of 64 bits using a 64 bit user's key, outputs 64 bits of ciphertext
- A **product cipher**, i.e., contains transpositions and substitutions
	- Basic unit of encryption is the bit
	- Performs both substitution and transposition (permutation) on the bits.
- Algorithm consists of **16 rounds** (iterations), User's key is reduced to **56 bits ("subkey")** after dropping the *parity bits* (these are to ensure each byte has an odd number of 1's - just for error detection). Each round has a **48 bit** **key ("round key")** generated from the user's key.

### Generation of 16 Round Keys (K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>, ... K<sub>16</sub>) (one / round)
![[Photos/CPS571-L03-1.png]]
Where PC-1 ("Permutation Choice 1") and PC-2 are known permutation tables,
LSH: Left Shifts (one or two bit shifts)
C<sub>i</sub> and D<sub>i</sub> are registers which hold 28 bits of the perms. each. Their content is concatenated, permuted and cut to 48 bits.

**DES Encipherment - 16 round of encipherment with different keys (*K<sub>i</sub>***)
In each round: 
1. the 64-bit input is split into $L_0$ and $R_0$, each 32 bits
2. $R_0$ is passed through the $F$ function (involves the S-boxes and $K_1$)
3. $R_0$ becomes the left part of the output, and $L_0$ is XOR'd with $F(R_0, K_1)$ to create $R_1$

The "s boxes" are known

DES Modes:
Direct use of DES is known as **Electronic** **Code Book Mode** (ECB)
- Encipher each block of 64 bits independently -rarely used and was considered weak

**Cipher Block Chaining Mode** (**CBC**)
- XOR each block with previous ciphertext block
- Requires an initialization vector for first one.

![[CPS571-L03-5.png]]

**Encrypt-Decrypt-Encrypt Mode** (2 keys, K, K'); used in financial institution
c = DES<sub>k</sub>(DES<sub>k'</sub><sup>-1</sup>(DES<sub>k</sub>(m)))

**Encrypt-Encrypt-Encrypt Mode** (3 keys: k, k', k'')

### Current Status of DES
DES design decisions were not made public
Design for computer system, associated software that could break any DES-enciphered message in a few days was published in 1998.

NIST selected *Rijndael* (original Dutch name) as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), successor to DES in 2001. 
- Original DES was officially withdrawn in 2005
- Only approved implementation of DES is triple DES.
## AES: Advanced Encryption Standard
- Processes data in **128**-bit (16 byte) - blocks
- AES can have **128**, **192**, **or** **256** bit keys
- Number of rounds is function of the key length.
	- 128 bit key: 10 rounds
	- 192 bit key: 12 rounds
	- 256 bit key: 14 rounds
- Data block and the key are depicted as square matrix of bytes 
- At least 10 rounds, including round keys, substitution of bytes, shifting of rows and mixing of columns. 

| in0 | in4 | in8  | in12 |
| --- | --- | ---- | ---- |
| in1 | in5 | in9  | in13 |
| in2 | in6 | in10 | in14 |
| in3 | in7 | in11 | in15 |

### Decryption of AES
- Round key schedule is reversed
- Ciphertext is placed into a state array, which is then combined with zeroth round key (of reversed schedule)
1. Rows are cyclically shifted, in inverse rotation
2. InvSubBytes reverses SubBytes using S-boxes that are inverse to one used in SubBytes.
3. Result XOR'ed with round key (of reversed schedule) - AddRoundKey
4. Each column independently altered in - InvMixColumns


AES was designed to withstand attacks that the DES is vulnerable to
All details of design decisions are made public (unlike DES)
- In particular, those of the substitutions (S-boxes were described)
- After 2 successive rounds, every bit in the state array depends on every bit in the state array 2 rounds ago
- No weak, semi-weak keys like in DES.

AES has the same modes as DES
EDE and "Triple-AES" not used
- Extended block size makes this unnecessary
- New counter mode CTR added.


## Alternatives to DES and AES
- Blowfish developed by B. Schneider 
	- It has dynamic S boxes and XOR function but also uses binary addition
	- Fits in 5KB of memory and needs 521 rounds for subkey generation
		- Not suitable for frequent key change
- RC4 is a stream cipher which operates on Bytes
