### Lists
Useful, basic, abstract. Much more flexible than arrays.

Internal representation: "Cons Cell" structure

A "cons cell" can be thought of a box with two slots. 
1. Pointer to data
2. Pointer to another slot.

Of course, in the case of a nested list, the "pointer to data" can point to another cons cell.

`(A NIL B)` is the same as `(A () B)`

#### List Accessors
`(first '(a b c d))` => a
`(car '(a b c d))` => a

`(rest '(a b c d))` => (b c d)
`(cdr '(b c d))` => (c d)
`(rest (cdr '(a b c d)))` => (c d)

```Lisp
(defun fourth (a)
	(car (cdr (cdr (cdr a)))))
```
Each `cdr` returns the list **after** the **first** element.
`car` returns the following element.

### The list CONstructor
CONS creates a cons cell:
- Takes 2 parameters, 
- returns a pointer to a new cons cell whose CAR points to the first parameter and whose CDR points to the second.

`cons` allocates memory for a new node.
`(cons 'sink '(or swim))` => `(sink or swim)`

It's fast and easy to add something to the beginning of the list, adding something to the end requires traversing the whole list.

```Lisp
(defun mymake-list-rec (n element &optional (acc nil))
	(if (= n 0) acc
	(mymake-list-rec (1- n) element cons element acc)))
```
```LISP
CL-USER> (mymake-list-rec 3 'a)
(A A A)
```

#### DOLIST Macro
```EBNF
(DOLIST (var list-form [result-form])
	body form*)
```

HMWRK: check this:
```Lisp
 (defun get-odds-it (alist) 
	 (let ((acc nil)) 
		 (dolist (elem alist acc) 
		 (if (oddp elem) (setf acc (elem acc))))))
```



What if we create our own list data type?
- A **node** tuple stores:
	- **data**
	- **next**
- List object will be represented as a tuple with two slots:
	- **head**
	- **size**

```Lisp
(defstruct node
  data next)

(defstruct my-list
  (head nil :type (or node null))
  (size 0 :type (integer 0)))

(defun my-cons (data list)

  (let ((new-node (make-node :data data
                             :next (my-list-head list))))
    (make-my-list :head new-node
                  :size (1+ (my-list-size list)))))
```
Remember that colons are used to denote keys.

Note that `(cons 'b (cons 'a nil))` => `(B A)`
We accomplish the same thing with `my-cons` but using our own structs (`my-list` and `node`)

```Lisp
(defstruct node
  data next)

(defstruct my-list
  (head nil :type (or node null))
  (size 0 :type (integer 0)))

(defun my-cons (data list)

  (let ((new-node (make-node :data data
                             :next (my-list-head list))))
    (make-my-list :head new-node
                  :size (1+ (my-list-size list)))))
```

For homework, make a `my-elt` function (and maybe a "dolist"?)
