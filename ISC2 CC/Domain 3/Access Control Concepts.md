A "**Security Control**" is a safeguard/countermeasure designed to preserve an element of the CIA triad.


### Access Controls
Are about restricting access to information systems/data as well as allowing the right access to the right people.

Access is based on three elements:
- **Subjects**
	- Any entity that requests access to assets (e.g. user, client, process, etc.)
	- Are active (it initiates a request for access to resources/services)
	- Requests a service from an object.
	- Has a level of clearance (permissions) that relate its ability to successfully access services or resources.
- **Objects**
	- Anything that a subject attempts to access (e.g. building, computer, file, database)
	- Is passive (takes no action until called upon by a subject)
	- Does NOT control their own access control logic.
	- Has a *owner* whom has the right to determine who/what should be allowed to access the object.
- **Rules**
	- Instruction developed to allow OR deny access to an object by comparing the validated identity of the subject to an *access control list*.
	- May permit time-based access.

## Defence in Depth
"Layered defence strategy"
Integrates:
- people
- technology
- operations capabilities
Establishes "variable barriers" across multiple layers and missions of an organization.

Technical examples of "Defence in depth" include:
- MFA
- Multiple firewalls for different security requirements

##### Privileged access management
Based on the **Principle of Least Privilege**. 

##### Logical Access Controls
Electronic methods to limit access even if the person has physical access.
- Passwords
- Biometrics
- Badge/token readers.

#### Controls and Risks
A control serves to reduce the risk.

Physical control: Seatbelt
Administrative control: Law requiring a seatbelt
